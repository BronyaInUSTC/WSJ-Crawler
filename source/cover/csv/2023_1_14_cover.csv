0,2023-01-13,Americas Biggest Banks Are Girding for a Recession but Arent Feeling One Yet - WSJ,Banks collectively stowed away $2.8 billion to cover potential loan losses,"['The nations largest banks said rising interest rates are likely to push the U.S. into a recession this year, though they are only starting to feel the effects in their quarterly earnings.', 'The four largest commercial banks reported mixed fourth-quarter results on Friday. Lending grew more profitable and consumers continued to spend on credit cards, but the banks collectively stowed away $2.8 billion in the final three months of 2022 to cover potential loan losses. JPMorgan Chase JPM 2.52%increase; green up pointing triangle &amp; Co. set aside nearly half of it.', '""It may be a mild recession. It may not be,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a call with reporters.', 'The banks profit rose 6% from a year ago, and Bank of America Corp.s BAC 2.20%increase; green up pointing triangle rose 2%. Citigroup Inc.s C 1.69%increase; green up pointing triangle profit fell 21%, and Wells Fargo WFC 3.25%increase; green up pointing triangle &amp; Co.s profit declined 50% after it took a charge tied to a regulatory settlement. Together, they posted an 8% rise in revenue.', 'All four beat Wall Streets expectations for per-share earnings. Wells Fargo missed expectations for revenue.\xa0', 'The bank results are another reminder of how the Federal Reserves rate-raising campaign against inflation is affecting all corners of markets and the economy. The rate increases are meant to slow down the economy, and many economists expect the U.S. to tip into a recession this year. The uncertainty has had a chilling effect on U.S. stock indexes, which just wrapped up their worst year since the 2008 financial crisis.', 'The Feds rate increases have already dramatically slowed the rate-sensitive housing market. At Wells Fargo, once the largest mortgage lender in the U.S., originations plunged to about $15 billion from $48 billion a year ago. That was the lowest since at least 2006, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance. The bank this week said it would scale back its mortgage business.', 'At JPMorgan, consumer mortgage originations plummeted to about $7 billion from $42 billion a year ago. That was the lowest volume since at least 2004.', 'The uncertainty in markets and the economy also made corporate chieftains wary of striking big deals. Investment-banking revenue, which soared during a pandemic deal making bonanza, fell more than 50% at Bank of America and nearly 60% at JPMorgan and Citigroup.\xa0', 'But higher rates were also helpful to the banks, allowing them to charge more on loans even though they havent started paying much more on deposits. JPMorgans profit on lending rose 48% to a record $20.2 billion. Citigroups business managing cash and lending to global corporations posted a 36% gain in revenue.\xa0', 'Volatile markets also kept traders busy, especially for securities tied to rates. Trading revenue was up 7% at JPMorgan and 18% at Citigroup. Adjusted trading revenue rose 27% at Bank of America.\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'The banks sit in the middle of an economy that is still faring relatively well, but higher rates are beginning to put some wear and tear on it. The Fed raised rates seven times in 2022, and the effects have yet to fully trickle through the economy. Inflation is slowing, but high prices are still stretching many U.S. households. Americans are spending down their pandemic savings.\xa0', 'Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said 2022 was ""a turning point in the economic cycle.""', 'On a call with analysts, he said the effects of the Feds tightening are starting to show up in consumer spending, housing and demand for goods and services. ""But at this point, the impact to consumers and businesses has been manageable,"" Mr. Scharf said.\xa0', 'The banks said that their customers continue tospend on discretionary items, including travel. Customers at the four banks collectively spent 10% more on their credit cards compared with a year ago.', 'They also stopped paying off the charges so quickly. Credit-card balances rose a collective 17% at the four banks.\xa0', 'Still, defaults remain historically low.', '""We are not seeing any significant increases in losses,"" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters. ""We certainly arent seeing anything beyond the normalization wed expect.""', 'The bank wrote off 1.7% of credit card loans for its Citi-branded cards, but Mr. Mason said he would normally expect to lose almost twice as much.', 'The banks also warned the lift from rates would dwindle this year. They will face pressure to start paying more to depositors and wont get to keep raising the interest they charge on loans, executives said.\xa0', 'JPMorgan said it expects its 2023 lending profit to slow from the quarters pace, disappointing analysts. And executives at JPMorgan and Bank of America both said deposits have started leaving to chase higher rates. Deposits fell 5% at JPMorgan, 6% at Bank of America and 7% at Wells Fargo.\xa0\xa0', '""As we moved forward through 2022, customers with excess cash, investment-oriented cash, sought yield as rates increased for money-market funds, direct Treasurys and other products,"" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said on a call with analysts.', 'Total loans were up at JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.', 'JPMorgan and Bank of America shares rose 2.5% and 2.2% respectively. Wells Fargo added 3.2%, while Citigroup advanced 1.7%.\xa0', 'Write to David Benoit at David.Benoit@wsj.com.

Mr. Bolsonaro hasnt conceded defeat.', 'Mr. Bolsonaro, who has been in the U.S. since late December, this week condemned acts of vandalism and the invasion of government buildings after thousands of his supporters attacked the presidential palace, Congress and the Supreme Court.', 'Mr. Bolsonaro ""has always repudiated all illegal and criminal acts, and always spoken publicly against such illicit conduct, just as he has always been a defender of the constitution and democracy,"" Frederick Wassef, Mr. Bolsonaros lawyer, said in a statement Friday.', 'The Supreme Courts announcement late Friday came after a request from the Brazilian prosecutor generals office to investigate Mr. Bolsonaro over the weekends turmoil. ', 'The court has powers\xa0to authorize the investigation and arrest of suspects, and it has taken an active role in thwarting what it says is antidemocratic behavior by Mr. Bolsonaros supporters, drawing criticism\xa0of political bias\xa0from right-wing parties.', 'Since the riots, the court has ordered the removal of Brasílias federal district governor, a Bolsonaro ally. It also ordered the arrest of Anderson Torres, the secretary in charge of public security in Brasília, and Fábio Vieira, commander of the military police in the city at the time of the riots. ', 'Mr. da Silvas government has said it is investigating who funded and organized the protests that turned into an assault on government buildings. ', 'Prosecutors on Friday said Mr. Bolsonaro had eroded trust in the electoral system for years. His public comments, prosecutors said, helped motivate those who ""practiced violent acts and took part in serious antidemocratic acts in the country."" ', 'They pointed to Mr. Bolsonaros weekly live broadcasts on social media, public statements and declarations to supporters on the street in which he warned that the voting system could be rigged. Mr. Bolsonaro also met with dozens of foreign diplomats in July last year and cast doubts on the reliability of the electoral system, prosecutors wrote.', 'Prosecutors also cited comments made by Mr. Bolsonaro a day after the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in 2021, when he used the example of the Capitol attack to argue for getting rid of Brazils electronic voting system.', 'At the time, Mr. Bolsonaro said Brazil needed to change its voting system, or ""its problems would be much worse than those of the U.S.""', 'Prosecutors also mentioned assertions by Mr. Bolsonaro that he had won the 2018 election by a much larger margin than the one announced by the electoral court. In public statements, Mr. Bolsonaro has often cited a case in which a hacker got inside the electronic voting system in 2018-an incident that police said didnt alter the result. ', 'Prosecutors also cited screenshots published by the Brazilian press showing that two days after the Brasília riots, Mr. Bolsonaro reposted a video on Facebook that claimed Mr. da Silvas election was fraudulent. He later deleted the repost.', '""In itself, this may seem inoffensive to untrained eyes, but considering the wider context, it appears, in principle, to constitute a serious form of inciting all of his followers to commit crimes,"" prosecutors said. They listed possible offenses of vandalism to attempting a coup.

2,2023-01-13,Supreme Court Investigators Have Narrowed Leak Inquiry to Small Number of Suspects - WSJ,At least one law clerk is among those suspected of leaking the draft abortion ruling in May,"['WASHINGTON-Supreme Court investigators probing the May leak of Justice Samuel Alitos draft opinion overruling Roe v. Wade have narrowed their inquiry to a small number of suspects including law clerks, but officials have yet to conclusively identify the alleged culprit, people familiar with the matter said.', 'A day after the draft opinion was published last year by Politico, Chief Justice John Roberts assigned the Supreme Courts marshal, Gail Curley, to investigate the leak. The court has released no information regarding the investigation since then. Little has emerged elsewhere, apart from a demand from investigators in June that justices law clerks sit for interviews and surrender their cellphones, prompting several of the three-dozen clerks serving in May to seek legal counsel.', 'A Supreme Court spokeswoman didnt respond to requests for comment.', 'Congressional Republicans have complained about the lack of information regarding the source of the leak.', '""For some reason this individual has certainly been sheltered and there is absolutely evidence that there are specific people who know who this person is,"" Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (R., Wis.) said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in December, when Democrats controlled the chamber now under Republican leadership.', 'At the same hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), now the House Judiciary Committee chairman, said the committee should itself investigate the leak.', 'Ms. Curley, a lawyer and former Army officer, oversees the Supreme Courts in-house police force, which has an authorized strength of 189 officers and principal missions of patrolling the courts property and protecting the justices. With its own police having little experience in complex investigations, the court brought in assistance from outside government investigators, people familiar with the matter said. By early summer, investigators had significantly narrowed the field of suspects, the people said.', 'The interviews were sometimes short and superficial, a person familiar with the matter said, consisting of a handful of questions such as ""Did you do it? Do you know anyone who had a reason to do it?"" Investigators relied in part on publicly available information about court employees to develop theories, the person said.', 'Speaking at a judicial conference in September, Justice Neil Gorsuch said that Chief Justice Roberts had appointed an internal committee to oversee the investigation and that it was expected to issue a report. The court hasnt said whether the report will be made public.', 'The May leak, while not necessarily unlawful, was an extraordinary breach of protocol at a court that tightly controls access to its deliberations. Law clerks-recent law-school graduates who win coveted one-year positions assisting a justice-are drilled in the courts culture of confidentiality and warned to avoid reporters, lest secrets slip. Any under investigation served during the 2021-22 term.', 'Each justice is allotted four law clerks, but dozens of other court employees might also have had access to the draft opinion.', 'At times, hints of the courts internal dynamics have emerged before decisions were published, but the leak of a complete draft opinion was unprecedented and, several justices have said, devastating to relations within the court.', 'The leak came amid rumors that Chief Justice Roberts was seeking to persuade some members of the courts conservative majority to join him in a half-step that would partly curb access to abortion, rather than fully eliminating the right, which women had held since the 1973 Roe decision, to end unwanted pregnancies before fetal viability.', 'Following the leak, the court issued a statement asserting that the draft opinion, which bore a February date, did ""not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case,"" Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization.', 'When the final decision came on June 24, however, it was nearly identical to Justice Alitos February draft. Four other conservatives joined him in the majority, while three liberal justices dissented. Chief Justice Roberts filed a concurring opinion agreeing that states should be permitted to restrict abortions prior to fetal viability, but arguing it was unnecessary in the Dobbs case, which involved the constitutionality of a Mississippi law barring the procedure after a woman was 15 weeks pregnant.']",https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-investigators-have-narrowed-leak-inquiry-to-small-number-of-suspects-11673635774?mod=hp_lead_pos3

Republicans in the House have launched their own inquiries. GOP members of the Judiciary Committee on Friday demanded Attorney General Merrick Garland relinquish documents and communications among Justice Department and FBI officials and the White House. The Justice Department confirmed receipt of the letter and declined to comment on it.', 'The Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee also sent a letter to the White House on Friday, saying his panel was investigating ""Mr. Bidens pattern of mishandling classified materials,"" and requesting the retrieved documents and a list of locations that were searched. The White House declined to comment.', 'Even some top Democrats are calling for more information. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D., Va.) said earlier this week he expected to be briefed on how the classified documents found their way to Mr. Bidens office.', 'A lurching response from the White House has only exacerbated the problems. The administration didnt disclose the initial discovery when it happened in November, or when further documents were discovered in December. When news reports surfaced earlier this week, White House officials on successive days issued succinct statements of confirmation. Officials in press briefings offered little additional detail while maintaining that the administration was being transparent-a pledge the president has repeatedly made to the public.', 'The discovery prompted immediate comparisons to the efforts by the National Archives and the Justice Department to retrieve classified and other documents from the Florida residence of former President Donald Trump, which escalated over more than a year to include a criminal investigation into possible obstruction, among other potential crimes. Mr. Trump has called the probe a witch hunt and denied wrongdoing.', 'The White House has repeatedly noted that lawyers for Mr. Biden quickly contacted the National Archives and the Justice Department after the documents surfaced, seeking to draw a contrast with Mr. Trumps actions. A monthslong effort by the Justice Department to retrieve classified documents in Mr. Trumps possession resulted in an August search of his property by federal agents.', 'Some Democrats said the discovery of classified documents in locales closely associated with Mr. Biden could deflate some of the political advantage Democrats might have sought from Mr. Trumps travails.', '""Republicans will try to muddy the waters,"" said Josh Schwerin, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, adding that Democrats will now have to more carefully lay out the differences between the two classified-document incidents. ""Democrats need to keep talking about how this is not the same situation as Trump and what he has done is significantly worse.""', 'Late last year, Mr. Trump officially declared himself a GOP presidential candidate for 2024 and Mr. Biden is expected to announce his bid for re-election in the spring.', 'White House staffers have been privately venting their frustrations that the discovery of the classified documents-and the resulting wall-to-wall coverage on cable news-are already distracting from what they thought was a good stretch for Mr. Biden. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the public is more focused on other issues, such as the economy, where the administration has been touting the influx of funds that will come from Democrat-backed legislation to boost infrastructure and invest in clean energy.', '""Our message is very clear and it will continue to be just that,"" she said at the White House on Friday.', 'During White House briefings this week, Ms. Jean-Pierre declined to provide direct answers to a range of questions from reporters on the documents. Among them: Why the White House didnt disclose the discovery earlier, who was responsible for packing up then-Vice President Bidens documents, whether the president would agree to an interview with the special counsel and how the documents found their way to Mr. Bidens home and office.', 'She repeatedly referred reporters questions to the Justice Department and the White House counsels office, which provided little additional information beyond their public statements.', '""Were not avoiding anything here,"" Ms. Jean-Pierre told reporters on Friday. ""We have spoken when its appropriate."" She said the White House is being cautious about the information it provides about the incident out of respect for the Justice Department investigation.', '""Its certainly going to be a distraction-some people are going to see blood in the water,"" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who has served as an adviser to Mr. Bidens outside political groups. He added that once the initial frenzy over the discovery passed, voter concerns over the economy and other issues might once again take center stage. ""I think this will probably be a sideshow.""', 'Mr. Garland provided the most detailed timeline of the discovery of the documents when he appointed the special counsel on Thursday. In naming Mr. Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, the Justice Department confirmed that aides found documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, the presidents Washington-based think tank, on Nov. 2, and turned them over to the National Archives.', 'Five weeks later, on Dec. 20, Mr. Bidens lawyers told the department that additional documents with classified markings dating to Mr. Bidens time in the Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Bidens home in Wilmington, Del., prompting the FBI to go there and retrieve them.', 'And Thursday morning, Mr. Bidens lawyer told officials an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the presidents home in Wilmington.

4,2023-01-13,J&amp;J Slashes Production of Its Unpopular Covid-19 Shot - WSJ,Drugmaker ends production contracts and is in arbitration with Merck,"['After mobilizing to quickly develop and manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson has vastly scaled back its efforts in producing the shots as it faces slumping demand.', 'The New Brunswick, N.J., pharmaceutical company in recent months terminated manufacturing agreements with companies that helped produce the shot during the pandemic such as Catalent Inc. and Sanofi SA.\xa0', 'Meanwhile, a partnership with rival Merck &amp; Co. to help make the shots, forged at the urging of the U.S. government, hasnt lived up to expectations. The companies are now engaged in arbitration.\xa0', 'Merck, of Rahway, N.J., has produced J&amp;J vaccines at only one of its plants, while it didnt make commercialdoses at another plant that involved a more complex part of the manufacturing process, according to people familiar with the matter.\xa0', '""They were trying to do this the best way possible to meet global demand but all of those plans fell apart,"" said Prashant Yadav, a supply-chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a think tank focused on cutting poverty.', 'J&amp;J said it is making its Covid-19 vaccine available where needed, and it has hundreds of millions of doses available. It didnt comment on whether it will continue to produce it.\xa0', 'U.S. regulators cleared the J&amp;J vaccine for use in February 2021, with high hopes from health authorities because it was a single-dose shot and carried fewer cold-chain storagerequirements than other shots. J&amp;Js initial supply was small, leaving the company and governments scrambling to increase doses. At least nine companies agreed to help manufacture J&amp;Js shot, according to J&amp;J and the companies.\xa0', 'Yet J&amp;Js vaccine hasnt been as widely used as the Moderna Inc. or Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE shots. Manufacturing issues limited the shots availability and the risk of a rare but serious blood-clotting condition dissuaded some people from using it.\xa0Roughly 400 million doses of the original Pfizer-BioNTech shot and nearly 250 million doses of the original Moderna shot have been administered in the U.S., compared with about 19 million J&amp;J doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'To increase the then-limited J&amp;J vaccine supply, the Biden administration announced in March 2021 that Merck would help produce J&amp;J pandemic vaccines, hailing it as a ""historic manufacturing collaboration.""\xa0', 'Merck, whose efforts to develop its own Covid-19 vaccine were unsuccessful, agreed to deploy two of its U.S. manufacturing plants to make J&amp;Js doses, helped by more than $100 million from the government to upgrade them. The U.S. government also invoked the Defense Production Act to give Merck priority access to supplies.\xa0', 'Under the partnership, Merck was to help J&amp;J with two phases of manufacturing its vaccine. At a Durham, N.C., facility, Merck would produce the so-called drug substance, the early and complex stages of manufacturing. At its West Point, Pa., plant it would complete the final stages of the vaccines production, a shorter process known as fill-and-finish.', 'Merck began rolling out the first J&amp;J doses of its Pennsylvania plant in late 2021, primarily for use outside the U.S. Merck declined to comment on whether production at its Pennsylvania plant has continued.', 'Despite upgrades to the Durham facilities, Merck hasnt produced any commercial doses at that plant, according to people familiar with the matter.\xa0', 'Mercks productionwas delayed because vaccine ingredients and manufacturing components arrived later than planned and because of technical issues at the plant, one of the people said. The components were partly late because the U.S. government stopped giving priority to J&amp;J orders under the Defense Production Act, delaying the arrival of materials that were difficult to source, this person said.\xa0', 'Merck and J&amp;J still anticipated commercial production at Durham as of October of 2021, the companies said at the time. J&amp;J expected the plant to be added to J&amp;Js emergency use authorization with U.S. health regulators in the second quarter of 2022, which would make doses from the plant eligible for distribution, Remo Colarusso, head of J&amp;Js pharmaceutical supply chain, said in an interview at the time.', 'That hasnt happened, according to a person familiar with the matter.', 'In October 2022, J&amp;J filed a demand for arbitration against Merck, in connection with the companies vaccine partnership, according to securities filings by the companies. Merck, in turn, filed a response to J&amp;Js arbitration demand and its own counterclaims, filings from the companies show.\xa0', 'The companies didnt disclose the nature of the dispute. Many corporate contracts require arbitration of any disagreements, to head off costly and public litigation in court.\xa0', 'Representatives for J&amp;J declined to comment on the arbitration.\xa0', 'Merck looks forward to presenting its position to the arbitration panel, a company spokesman said.', 'The action against Merck came as J&amp;J ended contracts with other companies. J&amp;J terminated its Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing agreement with French drugmaker Sanofi due to decreased demand, a Sanofi spokesman said.\xa0', 'Catalent, a Somerset, N.J.,-based contract manufacturer that has made doses of Covid-19 vaccines, said in November it agreed to early termination of contracts with J&amp;J for fill-and-finish of vials of the vaccine. Catalent said it received payments of $54 million from J&amp;J to resolve the contracts in October.\xa0', 'J&amp;J said in June it planned to terminate its Covid-19 vaccine supply contract with\xa0manufacturer Emergent BioSolutions Inc., and both companies accused each other of breaching the agreement. The companies disagree on the amount of money J&amp;J owes Emergent, according to an Emergent securities filing. Contamination problems at Emergents Baltimore plant forced the destruction of tens of millions of doses of J&amp;Js vaccine in early 2021, though additional batches were later cleared by regulators for distribution.', 'South Africas Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. produced 225 million doses of the J&amp;J shot through a contract-manufacturing agreement. The company received a license from J&amp;J to make the vaccine under Aspens branding, called Aspenovax, in November 2021, said Stavros Nicolaou, senior executive of strategic trade.\xa0', 'So far Aspen hasnt received any orders, which is due to declining demand and because nongovernmental organizations that purchased vaccines for Africa and low-income countries had already procured other shots from different suppliers, said Mr. Nicolaou.\xa0', 'J&amp;J also said it had manufacturing agreements with Biological E. Limited of India, IDT Biologika GmbH of Germany and Spains Laboratorio Reig Jofre SA. Biological E. and IDT declined to comment. Reig Jofre was part of J&amp;Js manufacturing network in 2021 and 2022, the company said, but declined to comment further.\xa0', 'Rather than try to be a player in an oversaturated Covid-19 vaccine market, Dr. Yadav said that J&amp;J could redirect its efforts to other products. He also said that the lack of a bivalent, or retooled vaccine to target new strains, is a disadvantage for J&amp;J.\xa0', 'J&amp;J initially expected to book $3 billion to $3.5 billion in Covid-19 vaccine sales for full-year 2022, but abandoned that forecast in April, citing a surplus of doses and uncertain demand. The company reported roughly $1.5 billion in global sales of the vaccine for the first nine months of 2022, up from $766 million a year earlier.\xa0\xa0']",https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-j-slashes-production-of-its-unpopular-covid-19-shot-11673624729?mod=hp_lead_pos5

Advertisers in recent years have flocked to Twitter during the Super Bowl to generate buzz around their big game marketing efforts. The Super Bowl is Twitters biggest revenue day of the year, the Journal has reported.\xa0', 'Twitter is facing financial pressure to lure back the many advertisers that have paused their spending since Mr. Musk acquired the company in late October.

In 2021, the average car contained about 1,200 chips worth $600, twice as many as in 2010.', 'The supply-chain crunch that created a chip shortage brought the lesson home. Auto makers lost $210 billion of sales last year because of missing chips, according to consulting firm AlixPartners. Competition with China has stoked concerns that it could dominate key chip sectors, for either civilian or military uses, or even block U.S. access to components.', 'Now the government and companies are spending billions on a frenetic effort to build up domestic manufacturing and safeguard the supply of chips. Since 2020, semiconductor companies have proposed more than 40 projects across the country worth nearly $200 billion that would create 40,000 jobs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

""Where the chip factories are for the next five decades is more important.""', 'As oil became a linchpin of industrial economies in the 1900s, the U.S. became one of the worlds largest producers. Securing the semiconductor supply is more complicated.

Given the economies of scale, the U.S. cant produce all of these itself.

""We are talking about making the U.S. a global leader in leading-edge production and creating self-sustaining dynamics going forward. Theres no doubt its a very ambitious set of objectives.""', 'The recent shortages that hurt the most didnt necessarily involve the most expensive chips. ', 'Jim Farley, Ford Motor Co.s chief executive, told a gathering of chip executives in San Jose, Calif., in November that factory workers, meaning workers in North America, had worked a full week only three times since the beginning of that year because of chip shortages. A lack of simple chips, including 40-cent parts needed for windshield-wiper motors in F-150 pickup trucks, left it 40,000 vehicles short of production targets.', 'Until 2014, machines that treat sleep apnea made by San Diego-based ResMed Inc. each contained just one chip, to handle air pressure and humidity. Then ResMed started putting cellular chips into the devices that beamed nightly report cards on users sleep patterns to their smartphones and to their doctors.', 'As a result, regular usage by users climbed from just over half to about 87%. Because mortality is lower for sleep-apnea sufferers who consistently use their devices, a relatively simple chip could help save lives.', 'ResMed couldnt get enough of the cellular chips during the chip shortage when demand for its machines went up, in part because a competitors devices were recalled. Some suppliers reneged on supply agreements. Patients faced monthslong waits.', 'Chief Executive Mick Farrell said he implored longstanding suppliers to give priority to his equipment, though his orders were relatively small. ""I asked for more, more and more, and to please prioritize us,"" he said. ""This is a case of life and death-were not just asking for something that makes you feel better.""', 'The company redesigned its machines, which are assembled in Singapore and Sydney, to replace the chips in short supply with others more readily available. It sought out new chip suppliers. It even rolled back the clock and released a version of a device without the cellular chip.', 'Though the chip shortage has abated somewhat and the companys newest breathing devices have the cellular chip back, Mr. Farrell worries chip supply could be a bottleneck.', 'In May, he was one of a group of medical-technology CEOs who pleaded with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on a conference call for help. Ms. Raimondos staff asked other federal agencies to designate medical equipment as essential and helped connect buyers directly to manufacturers to bypass distributors.', 'Such pleas also lent urgency to the Biden administrations efforts, led by Ms. Raimondo, to pass the Chips and Science Act. The U.S. has long been leery of industrial policy, under which the government rather than the market steers resources to particular industries. Many economists criticize industrial policy as picking winners. But many Republican and Democratic legislators argue that semiconductors should be an exception because, like oil, they have vital civilian and military uses.', 'Soon after the act passed, Intel, which had pushed Congress to pass the legislation for two years, broke ground on a $20 billion project in Ohio. The Commerce Department will announce guidelines next month for how the laws manufacturing subsidies will be awarded.', 'American scientists and engineers invented and commercialized semiconductors starting in the 1940s, and today U.S. companies still dominate the most lucrative links in the semiconductor supply chain: the design of chips, software tools that translate those designs into actual semiconductors, and, with competitors in Japan and the Netherlands, the multimillion-dollar machines that etch chip designs onto wafers inside fabrication plants, or fabs. ', 'But the actual fabrication of semiconductors has been increasingly outsourced to Asia. The U.S. share of global chip manufacturing has eroded, from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, while mainland Chinas share has gone from around zero to about 15%, according to Boston Consulting Group and SIA. Taiwan and South Korea each accounted for a little over 20%.', 'The most cutting-edge manufacturers of advanced logic chips, the brains of computers, smartphones and servers, are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.-a foundry that makes chips designed by others-and South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. Intel comes in third. Memory chips are primarily made in Asia by U.S.- and Asian-headquartered companies. Lower-end analog chips, which often perform just a few tasks in consumer and industrial products, are produced around the world.', 'The concentration of so much chip production in three hot spots-China, Taiwan and South Korea-unsettles U.S. military and political leaders. They worry that if China achieved dominance in leading-edge semiconductors, on its own or by invading Taiwan, it would threaten the U.S. economy and national security in a way Japan, an ally, didnt when it briefly dominated semiconductor manufacturing in the 1980s.', 'Starting around 2016, U.S. officials began blocking Chinese efforts to procure front-line chip companies and technology. Many in Washington were blindsided last July when a Canadian research firm reported that Chinas largest chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., had begun to manufacture 7-nanometer chips-a level of sophistication thought beyond its ability. ', 'With little warning, on Oct. 7, the U.S. government installed the broadest-ever restrictions on chip-related exports to China. The U.S. had long been willing to let Chinese semiconductor capabilities advance, as long as the U.S. maintained a lead. The new controls go much further, seeking to hold China in place while the U.S. and its allies race ahead.', 'Meanwhile, U.S. officials hope federal subsidies will lead to factories that are sufficiently large and advanced to remain competitive and profitable long into the future. ""We have got to figure out a way through every piece of leverage we have…to push these companies to go bigger,"" Ms. Raimondo said in an interview. ""I need Intel to think about taking that $20 billion facility in Ohio and making it a $100 billion facility. Weve got to convince TSMC or Samsung that they can go from 20,000 wafers a month to 100,000 and be successful and profitable in the United States. Thats the whole game here.""', 'That ambition comes at a delicate time for chip makers, many of whom have seen a sharp drop in demand for electronics that were hot during the early days of the pandemic. Intel is paring capital spending amid the slump, and TSMC said this week that weak demand could lead it to cut capital expenditures this year.', 'To defray the chip companies investment needs, Ms. Raimondo has approached private infrastructure investors about participating in chip projects, modeled on Brookfield Asset Management Inc.s co-investment in Intels Arizona fabs. Last November she pitched the idea to 700 money managers at an investment conference in Singapore organized by Barclays Bank.', 'She also approached chip customers including Apple Inc. about buying chips these fabs produce. ""We will need big customers to give commitments to purchase [the fabs output], which will help de-risk deals and show there is a market for these chips,"" she said.', 'Those efforts appeared to pay off in December when TSMC announced it would up its investment to $40 billion in leading-edge chips at a facility already being built on a vast scrubby area north of Phoenix. Formerly home to wild burros and coyotes, it now teems with construction cranes and takes delivery of some of the most advanced manufacturing equipment in the world.', 'At a ceremony that month attended by Mr. Biden and top administration officials, including Ms. Raimondo, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. chief Lisa Su pledged to buy some of the facilitys output.', 'Still, TSMC told the Commerce Department in a public letter that despite excitement about its plans and local, state and potentially federal subsidies, costs were higher than if a similar operation were built at home. Morris Chang, TSMCs founder, said in November that the differential could be 50%. TSMC said it sent more than 600 American engineers to Taiwan for training.', 'Outside the U.S., Europe has its own plans to double its share of global production over about 10 years, while authorities in Taiwan, China and other Asian nations are pouring money into the sector. TSMC, in addition to its Arizona project, is building a chip plant in Japan and is looking at potential investments in Europe.', 'The high cost and scarcity of qualified labor in the U.S. has hampered previous efforts to reshore electronics manufacturing. Mung Chiang, president of Purdue University in Indiana, said computer and engineering students are drawn to chip design or software, areas where American companies are leaders, rather than manufacturing.', '""Even if they say, Yes, semiconductor manufacturing sounds really good, I want to do it, well, where can they learn the real, live experience?""', 'In response, Purdue has created a dedicated semiconductor program it hopes will award more than 1,000 certificates and degrees annually by 2030 in person and online. In July, SkyWater Technology, a Bloomington, Minn.-based foundry, said it would build a $1.8 billion fab on Purdues campus, prospectively supported by Chips funding.', 'Developing a domestic supply of talent is only half the battle. The U.S. also depends on foreign countries for many key inputs to semiconductors.', 'The lasers that imprint tiny circuit blueprints on silicon wafers use purified neon gas, made from raw neon typically harvested from large air-separation units attached to steel plants. Those facilities produce the neon when they separate oxygen from the air for use in steel furnaces.', '<figure class=""css-1oar1n1-Figure e338ton0""><img alt=""image"" height=""426"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 979px) 300px, (max-width: 1299px) 300px, 300px"" src=""https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=639&amp;height=426"" srcset=""https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=300&amp;size=1.5 300w, https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=300&amp;size=1.5 300w, https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=300&amp;size=1.5 300w, https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=639&amp;size=1.5 639w, https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=639&amp;size=1.5&amp;pixel_ratio=1.5 958.5w, https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=639&amp;size=1.5&amp;pixel_ratio=2 1278w, https://images.wsj.net/im-702874/?width=639&amp;size=1.5&amp;pixel_ratio=3 1917w"" width=""639""/><div class=""css-1dj97of-ImgWithLinkWrapper e11056ax3""><p class=""css-1kgh3u5-PromoInteractiveIcon ec3b4j10"">', 'Since the steel industry largely moved out of the U.S. over the past half-century, there is currently very little neon gas being produced domestically.

Absolutely,"" said Matthew Adams, an executive vice president at Electronic Fluorocarbons LLC, a Massachusetts-based company that imports, purifies and sells neon and other gases. ""A prolonged ban of neon exports from China to the U.S. would shut down a significant portion of semiconductor production after inventories are exhausted.""', 'A handful of other raw materials used in chip making, such as tungsten, which is transformed into tungsten hexafluoride and used to build parts of transistors on chips, are similarly sourced primarily from China. To truly untie the U.S. chip industry from China would entail undoing several decades of globalization, something industry leaders say isnt practical.', 'Even if the U.S. doesnt succeed in securing the entire semiconductor supply chain, it does have a chance to reverse the recent historical pattern of losing leadership in one manufacturing sector after another, including passenger cars, railroad equipment, machine tools, consumer electronics and solar panels.', '""I dont think weve ever done this before: Try in a conscious, targeted way to regain market share in an industry where we were once the leader, but then lost it,"" said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which advocates government support of manufacturing.', 'Liza Lin contributed to this article.']",https://www.wsj.com/articles/chips-semiconductors-manufacturing-china-taiwan-11673650917?mod=hp_lead_pos7

Rather than  looking like one of the worlds fast-growing tech giants, which is how it was valued by investors, it now looks more like a car company.', 'Competitors have cut into its market share with new electric models that in some areas outperform Teslas. The company last brought a new passenger vehicle to market nearly three years ago, a long gap by Detroit standards. That has given buyers new choices at a time when some have soured on Teslas brand, thanks in part to Mr. Musks chaotic takeover of Twitter Inc. ', 'Tesla, which once boasted of boundless demand for its products, resorted recently to a tried and true tactic for old-line auto makers trying to move cars off the lot. In the final weeks of 2022, Tesla offered $7,500 discounts in the U.S. to entice buyers-and still came up short of its annual growth target.', 'This week, Tesla cut prices across its lineup in the U.S., some by nearly 20%, positioning buyers of a wider range of its vehicles to qualify for a federal tax credit. ', 'Worried Mr. Musk has been distracted with Twitter while these problems mounted, many Tesla shareholders are fuming. In a bad year for stocks, its share price has plunged by around 70% from its peak, wiping out some $850 billion in market value. Mr. Musk personally has lost more than $200 billion of his paper fortune. If Teslas stock were to continue falling, it would further erode the financial underpinnings of Mr. Musks business empire.', 'Some of the darkest clouds loom in China, the worlds largest auto market and the engine of much of Teslas growth for the past three years. Late in 2022, the company scaled back certain battery purchasing plans for 2023 amid softening demand there, people familiar with the matter said.', 'Tesla cut prices in China for its two most popular models by as much as around 13% after reporting a December slump in sales of its Shanghai-made vehicles. Its share of Chinas EV market fell last year as homegrown giant BYD Co., which offers a wider range of models at various price points, gained ground. Teslas factory in Shanghai is the companys largest by output, accounting for more than half of the EVs Tesla delivered last year.', '""Teslas understanding of what Chinese buyers want is not that accurate,"" said Andy An, chief executive of Chinese auto giant Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.s Zeekr electric-car brand. Teslas interior design, he said, lacks the premium feel that Chinese consumers are looking for.', 'Zeekr, a high-end brand whose 001 model competes with Teslas Model Y crossover, delivered nearly 72,000 vehicles last year, up from around 6,000 in 2021, the year the model launched. Tesla delivered 1.3 million vehicles globally in 2022.', 'Tesla didnt respond to requests for comment. Mr. Musk has suggested that higher interest rates are hurting demand for both Teslas cars and its shares.

They make movies about teams that are behind and then come back with a miracle,"" Mr. Clarke said of his rationale for joining Ford.', 'In December, as Tesla was discounting its vehicles, Ford raised the price of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup for the third time in 2022. The starting price for newly ordered trucks is now 40% higher than the Lightnings original price tag.', 'Last month, 37% of likely U.S. EV buyers surveyed by J.D. Power said they would consider buying a Ford, 39% a Tesla and 44% a Chevrolet, making the General Motors Co. unit the most-considered brand.', 'Stellantis NVs Dodge recently revealed a prototype of an all-electric version of the gas-powered Charger, which is slated for retirement at the end of this year. Known for producing cars used in drag racing, Dodge sacrificed range to preserve the driving dynamics of a traditional muscle car, a tradeoff that chief executive Tim Kuniskis said is aimed at appealing to enthusiasts. The car, Dodges first fully electric model, is slated to go on sale in 2024.', '""The car that were bringing to market-thats not a Tesla,"" Mr. Kuniskis said. ""It doesnt look like a Tesla. Its not going to drive like a Tesla. It doesnt sound like a Tesla. Nobodys going to confuse the two.""', 'In the U.S., Teslas share of the EV market fell to around 65% in 2022, from about 72% the year before, according to estimates from market-research firm Motor Intelligence.

As of last year, car companies and their suppliers had committed to spending more than $525 billion globally through 2026 on going electric, according to consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.', 'Tesla remains the undisputed global EV leader-and the worlds most valuable car company, even after its recent share-price decline. It has an established electric-vehicle supply chain, a yearslong lead in scaling manufacturing and an expansive, proprietary charging network.', 'As of year-end 2022, Tesla had cars rolling off the assembly line at an annualized pace of around 1.8 million yearly. Corporate forecasts indicate it is likely to be mid-decade before GM or Ford eclipses that rate of EV production.', 'As the auto industry began chasing Tesla, planning a barrage of new models, Mr. Musks focus at times seemed directed elsewhere. Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Mr. Musk added ""Technoking"" to his title. And, rather than revealing a new car, he promised to build a humanoid robot dubbed Optimus.', 'Tesla spent years developing an all-electric semitrailer truck, the first of which it delivered in December, launching it into the relatively niche long-haul trucking market.

Is the West Ready? - WSJ,Time could be on Russias side if the U.S. and its allies dont adjust to a prolonged conflict ,"['The war in Ukraine, its clear by now, wont end soon. The bet in Moscow-and the fear in Kyiv-is that the West will lose stamina before Russia suffers a decisive defeat.', 'So far, Russias expectations of discord among Ukraines backers havent materialized. Europe has severed its dependence on Russian energy with limited pain and no political cataclysms. As all major Western economies grew in 2022 despite the disruptions, the consensus behind supplying weapons to Kyiv has only solidified.', 'Yet, with Russia announcing a mobilization of hundreds of thousands of soldiers in September and switching its economy to a war footing, time could be on Moscows side. So far, neither the U.S. nor Europe has made the adjustments, especially in military production, that are necessary for sustaining Ukraine in a war that could potentially drag on for several years. Neither are they immune to pain from further energy shocks.', '""The idea that a major classic conventional war in Europe could last as long as one of the two world wars is not something we are yet ready for,"" says Bruno Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a Paris think tank. ""Even though the resilience of European societies has been remarkable, it cannot be taken for granted.""', 'The same goes for the U.S. While the lame-duck Congress in December authorized $44.9 billion in funding to support the war in Ukraine, probably enough for the next nine months, new Republican control of the House means that further military and civilian aid packages for Kyiv may be more complicated to fund.', 'If time works to Moscows advantage, its in the Wests interest to dramatically increase support for Ukraine in coming months, abandoning the excessive caution that characterized weapons deliveries until now, says retired Air Marshal Edward Stringer, former head of operations at the British Defense Staff.', '""By continuing to drip-feed just enough for Ukraine not to lose, what the West is doing is just prolonging the war,"" Air Marshal Stringer says. ""Whether we realize it or not, Russia has thrown a gauntlet to the West. And, even though our own troops arent fighting there, we are thoroughly invested in this conflict, and we have to provide the materiel to win it.""', 'Ukraines own once-significant defense industry has been decimated by Russian airstrikes in the 11 months of war, and the country now is almost wholly reliant on Western-provided weapons and ammunition to survive. While Russias economy, roughly the size of Spains, is a minnow compared with the combined might of the U.S. and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, Western defense procurement and manufacturing-unlike Russias-is largely continuing to follow peacetime procedures and schedules.', '""The West, in general, naturally overshadows Russia in economic potential and defense-industrial capacity, and that should make you believe that, in a protracted war, Ukraine with Western support stands a much better chance of winning the conflict,"" says Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, a think tank that advises the U.S. military. ""But that is not a predetermined outcome. Potential is just that. It takes a great deal of will, and wars are fundamentally a contest of wills.""', 'Before last falls mobilization, Russia-which began the invasion using mostly full-time contract troops-suffered from manpower shortages in Ukraine while relying on an overwhelming advantage in artillery firepower. Now that Russia has mobilized 300,000 reservists, it has solved its manpower problem just as its starting to run low on ammunition and materiel.', 'Long term, the arithmetic of manpower works to Moscows advantage as Russia has 3.5 times Ukraines population. Even if Russia loses two soldiers for every one Ukrainian service member killed, it still improves its relative strength. So far, Western officials say, Russias battlefield fatalities-numbering in several tens of thousands-are comparable to Ukraines.', 'The calculus on ammunition and weaponry is more complicated. Ukraine uses up Western-supplied 155 mm artillery shells at roughly twice the rate that they are being manufactured by the U.S. and allies, military analysts say. At this rate of fire, Kyiv could draw down U.S. and European reserves to critical levels at some point this summer or fall.', 'By then, Russia-with its single-minded focus on the war-may be able to expand its own ammunition production to keep pace with the tempo of the fighting. The U.S. and allies are also investing in new ammunition production lines, but these are unlikely to make a major difference until next year, creating a potentially dangerous gap between Ukraines and Russias firepower in the second half of 2023.', '""We should not underestimate Russia. They are mobilizing more troops, they are working hard to acquire more equipment, more ammunition, and they have shown willingness to actually suffer but to continue the war,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says. ""There is no indication that President Putin has changed the overall aim of his brutal war against Ukraine. So we need to be prepared for the long haul.""', 'The mobilization has already allowed Mr. Putin to stabilize the front line, and to launch a counteroffensive around the city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region. Possibilities of a negotiated settlement are remote in the foreseeable future.', '""Any notion of the peace process is out because Putin is doing everything to make clear that this is existential for him,"" says Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who heads the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""He is preparing his population for a long war, and I dont think hes ever going to give up on his imperial ambitions for controlling Ukraine."" With no end to the conflict in sight, he says, the U.S. and allies should already start preparing to integrate the government-controlled majority of Ukraine into Western institutions, without waiting for the wars conclusion.', 'Ukraine says that its war aim is to oust Russia from all territories conquered in the past year and the areas it lost to Russia in 2014, including Crimea. Ukraine regaining even part of these areas would endanger Mr. Putins hold on power at home.', 'Russia seeks, at a minimum, to conquer the Ukrainian-held parts of Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that Mr. Putin declared to be part of Russia in October. Currently, almost the entire front line runs across what Russia considers to be its own sovereign soil.', 'Ukrainian officials warn that Moscows initial war goal, the occupation of Kyiv and the entirety of the country, hasnt changed-and that any pause in the conflict would be used by Mr. Putin to regroup and strike again. ', '""They are preparing for new battles, for new offensive operations, not for talks. Nothing speaks in favor of Russia being ready to talk,"" says Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

A standoff over government spending and the debt limit in 2011 caused a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and roiled financial markets.', 'Raising the debt limit doesnt incur new government spending, but instead authorizes the Treasury to borrow to pay for expenses Congress separately approves. A failure to pay U.S. government bondholders, Social Security recipients and others on time could have far-reaching economic consequences, Ms. Yellen warned.', '""Failure to meet the governments obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans and global financial stability,"" she said.', 'The federal deficit-the annual difference between government spending and revenue-exploded during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Republicans and Democrats injected more than $5 trillion of aid into the economy. As those pandemic aid programs wound down, the federal deficit dropped precipitously last fiscal year.', 'So far this fiscal year, which began in October, the federal deficit has increased by 12% compared with last year. Higher borrowing costs on the governments debt, caused by the Federal Reserves raising interest rates to fight inflation, are the primary driver of higher government spending this fiscal year.', 'The exact duration of the Treasurys extraordinary measures-which include halting investments in certain government funds-is uncertain because it hinges on broader economic conditions, like interest rates and tax receipts.', 'Democrats and Republicans have ultimately come together on an agreement on raising the debt limit repeatedly in recent years, including in 2021 when Senate Republicans dropped their demands that Democrats slash their other policy plans. But House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) promised conservatives he would fight over the issue as he campaigned for the speakership, making a series of procedural concessions that have emboldened conservative Republicans.', '""Spending is out of control,"" Mr. McCarthy said on Thursday. ""We cannot continue around the same process. I had a very good conversation with the president when he called me and I told him Id like to sit down with him early and work through these challenges.""', 'Republicans havent provided details of their proposal, but some have floated reductions in defense and nondefense spending, as well as changes to Medicare and Social Security to cut costs, with the aim of balancing the federal budget.', 'White House officials have criticized Republican plans to cut spending,\xa0saying\xa0the debt ceiling should be raised without conditions.\xa0', '""The president and the country will not stand for anyone saying, unless I can cut Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, or other programs seniors and middle-class and working families count on, I will cost tens of millions of Americans their jobs and retirement savings,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Friday.', 'The standoff over the debt limit comes at a fragile time for the economy. The Federal Reserves campaign to snub out inflation has left some worried that higher interest rates could tip the U.S. into a recession. Economic growth around the world is slowing.', 'Uncertainty over the reliability of Treasurys-a safe-haven asset around the world that underpins much of the financial system-could further cloud the economic outlook.', '""The thing that makes me most concerned is the timing,"" said  Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moodys Analytics.

10,2023-01-14,"This 3-D Printed Icelandic Fish-Gutting Machine Contains the Secret of a Future, Less-Globalized Economy - WSJ","Once suitable only for making prototypes, 3-D printing is now reliable enough for mass-produced commercial products, upending the way manufacturing works","['Hafnarfjarðarkaupstaður, Iceland, is a town of 30,000 souls built on a lava field, just south of the island nations capital city of Reykjavik. If sightseers come this way, its for tours of the homes of local ""hidden folk""-the dwarfs and elves of the Norse fairy tales that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien.', 'Tucked away in a nondescript 10,000-square-foot building there is a manufacturing facility that runs 24/7, producing parts for fish-processing machines in a way that was, even a few years ago, impossible. Elliði Hreinsson, the founder of Curio, which owns the building, says the machines he designs and makes would be difficult or in some cases impossible to produce without 3-D printing.', '""In Iceland, we are a small stone in the ocean, and we cannot so easily run around to get help,"" says Mr. Hreinsson. ""You have to be able to do it all in-house."" His machines, which he sells to clients around the world, include more than 100 parts that he prints on seven 3-D printers made by a company called Desktop Metal. Printing the stainless-steel parts this way skips all the steps required for conventional manufacturing, from prototyping to casting or injection molding-the last of which generally happens in Asia, and can add weeks or months to the time between product design and delivery.', 'Now that much of the hype around 3-D printing has died down-no more of that 2010s-era talk about a Star Trek-style replicator in every home-a funny thing is happening to this technology. Its becoming a widely used, and in some respects quietly revolutionary, update to the way that people manufacture and process things we rely on every day-from cars to industrial machinery to food. Whats more, the way this technology is being used could have implications for the shape of global supply chains to come.', 'A quick refresher: 3-D printing, also known as ""additive manufacturing,"" generally works by adding tiny layers of material-usually powdered metal or plastic-one at a time to form an item, and fusing them with binding agents, lasers or other methods. Thus, parts are ""grown"" instead of forged, cast, molded, or machined as in traditional manufacturing. Just a decade ago, this kind of manufacturing was, with rare exceptions, suitable only for creating prototypes. Whats different now is that newer technology lets these systems print objects strong enough to be used in finished products-and relatively quickly.', 'Recently, for example, General Motors made 60,000 weatherproof seals using 3-D printing, in plastic, rather than making them the old-fashioned way, to make sure it could deliver its 2022 Chevy Tahoe on time. The forthcoming Cadillac Celestiq, an ""ultra-luxury"" vehicle, will include more than 100 3-D-printed parts. BMW is making broad use of 3-D-printed parts throughout its lineup. Mercury Marine is producing its newest V12, 600-horsepower outboard motor with 3-D-printed molds.', 'And in Youngstown, Ohio, a 63-year old family business that has long made molds for casting metal parts such as engine blocks for auto makers now has a division that creates those molds with additive manufacturing, instead of conventional machining.\xa0', 'Humtown Additive does 3-D printing not with metal or plastic, but with sand. The resulting molds are used in a casting process that has changed little since its invention in ancient Egypt. Of course, the pharaohs didnt have computers, CAD software, or the ability to print complicated shapes using what is essentially an inkjet printer to spray a kind of glue into a block of fine, loose sand, one thin layer at a time.', 'When he started looking into it in the early 2010s, the manufacturing industry was not receptive to this new way of making castings, says Brandon Lamoncha, director of additive manufacturing at Humtown, which was started by his grandfather. Today, Humtown Additive has customers using as many as 50,000 3-D-printed molds a year, he adds. These sand-and-binder molds are used for everything from engine blocks for conventional trucks to the housings for motors in electric vehicles. All are produced on 3-D sand printers made by ExOne, a subsidiary of Desktop Metal. Like Mr. Hreinsson, Mr. Lamoncha runs his printers all-out, 24 hours a day, to keep up with demand.', 'Traditional sand casting, which Humtown also does, is a labor-intensive, multistep process requiring molds made in multiple parts, by machinists or some other manufacturing process, and theres much room for human error. By contrast, 3-D-printed sand casting skips all of those steps, and eliminates all of that labor, because it can go straight from a 3-D model to a final, printed mold.', '3-D printing is making rapid inroads into conventional manufacturing all over the world, but its still nascent. Globally, the entire industrial additive-manufacturing market grew to $13.3 billion in 2022, from $5.7 billion in 2016, says Chris Connery, an analyst at Context, a market-intelligence firm. That number includes software and services, materials and hardware like industrial 3-D printers, which start at around $100,000 and can cost millions.', 'That growth should accelerate in the next 5 years, with the size of the industry reaching $37.2 billion by 2026, as industrial 3-D printing displaces traditional mass manufacturing, he adds.', 'The biggest companies in the additive manufacturing industry mostly make systems that print in plastics, like Stratasys and 3-D Systems, both based in the U.S., and Germany-based EOS. In metal printing, Desktop Metal has the lions share of the market, but a number of other companies and startups, like Markforged, are making inroads. Well-known firms like HP, General Electric and Nikon have also recently made acquisitions and are either selling systems or using this technology internally.', 'Despite all the advances in 3-D printing, it is still often more cost-effective to manufacture things the old way, says Tripp Burd, an engineer at Markforged, which makes metal printers that compete with some models made by Desktop Metal.', '""This is not a technology to be blindly applied to everything in your warehouse, but used intelligently, its a very powerful tool,"" says Mr. Burd.', 'Companies can also use 3-D printing to do away with some of their inventory of spare parts, many of which can sit on warehouse shelves for years. Both Caterpillar, the worlds biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, and Saudi Aramco, the worlds largest producer of oil by volume, for example, are digitizing their libraries of old parts so that they can print them in 3-D as needed, when machines that may have working lives of decades break.', '3-D printing parts domestically, instead of making them outside the country in which they will be used, can also help companies get around supply-chain bottlenecks, factory shutdowns, and tariffs. During the pandemic, for example, Caterpillar began using some 3-D printed parts, made in the U.S. with Desktop Metal printers, in place of conventionally manufactured versions that had become difficult to import from India. Its project leads realized that at the volumes required, and given the costs of possible delays, it was economical to just 3-D print all of the parts needed, rather than making them with conventional techniques, says Desktop Metal Chief Executive Ric Fulop. ', 'Costs for 3-D printing parts have fallen precipitously in the past few years. This is no surprise given that some of the technologies involved werent even commercially available a decade ago, says Mr. Lamoncha, whose own journey with 3-D printing started in 2012 when the Obama administration funded a National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute in Youngstown. Those costs are projected to continue to fall, as 3-D printers become both faster and physically larger, which will mean they can produce more parts at once.', 'For now, Mr. Hreinsson, the Icelandic manufacturer of fish-processing machinery, is using the smallest of the 3-D metal printers offered by Desktop Metal. As more people learn to use such machines, and the usually conservative manufacturing industry comes to embrace them, he can see them transforming where manufacturing happens, leading to ""reshoring"" of both manufacturing and the industries it enables, from processing fish to making the objects we all rely on every day.', 'Before, fish were sent to China to be processed by hand, he adds. Now, they can be processed close to where they are caught, using machines he manufactures from parts that were once made in Asia, if they could be made at all.', '""What 3-D printing is doing now is revolutionary,"" says Mr. Hreinsson. ""Its not a dream anymore, its there, and its only going to grow.""', '<em class=""css-i6hrxa-Italic e1i5tkwa0"" data-type=""emphasis"">For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines,</em><em class=""css-i6hrxa-Italic e1i5tkwa0"" data-type=""emphasis""> sign up for our weekly newsletter</em><em class=""css-i6hrxa-Italic e1i5tkwa0"" data-type=""emphasis"">.</em>']",https://www.wsj.com/articles/3-d-printing-iceland-fish-supply-chains-desktop-metal-11673642250?mod=hp_lead_pos11
