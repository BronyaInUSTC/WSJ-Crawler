Germanys DAX index and Frances CAC 40 have each risen 18% or more in the past three months through Tuesday, more than double the 8.5% gain for the SThe turnabout underscores how drastically economic expectations have shifted regarding Europe-which only months ago was engulfed by, a possible  and  Those issueshavent gone away completely, though investors have felt more comfortable continuing to wade back into investing on the continent. The start of a new year hasnt derailed their optimism either. Gains for European indexes have so far this year outstripped those in the U.S., even after Tuesdays drop in stocks across Europe. The FTSE 100 lost 0.4% for the day, while the DAX edged down 0.1%. The SIn one recent sign of confidence, traders poured their largest two-week sum into U.K. stock funds since June. Investors added more than Meanwhile, positioning in the European futures market has grown more sanguine, according to Chris Montagu from Citi Research. Investors last week ramped up bullish bets across European indexes at a greater magnitude than across U.S. indexes. European stocks have ""shown a lot of resilience, probably more resilience than was expected,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.The strength of Europes bounceback is the result of both mechanics and fundamentals. Compared with the U.S., stock indexes in Europe arent dominated by the kinds of big technology stocks that have dragged down the U.S. market. In a higher interest rate environment, investors preference for value stocks-such as banks, retailers and energy companies-has benefited cyclically tilted European indexes. Prolonged weakness last year in the euro and the British pound against the dollar made European stocks cheaper and more attractive to some investors. Additionally, it was a boon to European companies that derive large chunks of revenues from overseas. A weaker euro and pound increases European companies export competitiveness and the value of their dollar-based revenues. A  and the pound in recent weeks-driven, in part, by growing optimism for the region-has more recently helped boost returns for dollar-based investors.The strength of European stock markets has also been driven by a stronger economic backdrop. A  has relieved investors worries that an energy crisis could torpedo the economy. Falling energy prices have also helped bring inflation down. Last week, data from the European Unions statistics agency showed that the annual rate of inflation, with consumer prices rising at their slowest pace since August. Inflation is The sudden easing of Chinas Covid-19 restrictions has provided an unexpected boost to some European stocks, including miners and the  Luxury goods giant  and Birkin-bag maker  SCA, for example, have each climbed 11% this year on hopes that Chinese consumers, an important component of the luxury market, will increase spending overseas.""There is a stronger connection between European stocks and China than with U.S. stocks,"" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Still, Mr. Ielpo said he wasnt optimistic about the outlook for Europe. Mr. Ielpo believes the European Central Bank is still in the early stages of its tightening cycle, and therefore more pain is likely awaiting European economies as borrowing costs rise. The long-term support that Chinas reopening can bring to European companies ""remains a big question mark,"" he said.""Short term, theres a flurry of positive factors that have been profiting European stocks,"" Mr. Ielpo said. ""Longer run, these factors are probably going to wane.""Another question is whether traders current preference for value stocks will persist. If technology stocks rebound sometime in 2023, that could dent the allure of European markets. ""The jurys still out at the moment,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild ""Its early days, we havent yet seen a peak in interest rates, and we cant yet be confident…about whether there will be a global recession or not in 2023,"" he said.Write to Caitlin McCabe at "

That made it all the more important, he added, for the central bank to ""stick to our knitting and not wander off"" into addressing issues that arent directly linked to its mandate to keep inflation low and to .""We are not, and will not be, a climate policy maker,"" Mr. Powell said. have put pressure on the central bank to take a more activist role in policing bank lending decisions to address climate change. Mr. Powell made the case for a much more limited role in which the Fed monitors how banks are managing an array of financial risks, including those posed by climate change-steps that have drawn disapproval from some Republicans and that were opposed last month by another Fed governor.While other central bankers have taken bolder steps to tackle climate change through their oversight of the financial sector, Mr. Powell suggested he didnt think the Fed had the same authority to do so because the issue lacks clear political consensus in the U.S.Using the Feds banking-supervision authorities to take more aggressive steps on climate change would be inappropriate without more explicit instructions from Congress to do so, he said.The Feds institutional arrangements-in which policy makers set interest rates , sometimes referred to as its independence-allow the central bank to take unpopular steps to fight inflation and slow the economy without having to worry about short-term political factors, Mr. Powell said. He didnt otherwise comment on the Feds .The Fed  last year, from near zero in March to just below 4.5% by the end of the year. Officials have signaled their intention to lift the rate above 5% this year, extending the  to combat inflation that has also been near a 40-year high.Separately, Fed governor Michelle Bowman  its benchmark rate, though incoming data would determine for how long and in what increment the Fed should lift it. Despite some signs of improvement in inflation, ""we have a lot more work to do,"" she told an audience of bankers in Miami.Mr. Powell was confirmed last spring  to a second four-year term as the Feds chair. But some senior Democratic lawmakers have more recently voiced alarm at the Feds rapid rate rises.The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), and the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), separately sent letters to Mr. Powell last fall warning against overdoing rate increases. ""You must not lose sight of your responsibility to ensure that we have full employment,"" Mr. Brown wrote in October.Other critics have been more outspoken. ""There is a big difference between landing a plane and crashing it,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said at a conference in November. ""Powell risks pushing our economy off a cliff.""Mr. Powell has said the central bank is trying to avoid unnecessary economic damage, , by slowing the pace of its rate rises. But he has repeatedly warned that there would likely be some pain in bringing down .In his remarks, Mr. Powell said he believes the ""benefits of independent monetary policy in the U.S. context are well understood and broadly accepted."" He also said grants of independence to agencies like the Fed should be ""exceedingly rare, explicit, tightly circumscribed, and limited to those issues that clearly warrant protection from short-term political considerations.""Write to Nick Timiraos at "
2,2023-01-10,Several Top Rivian Executives Depart the Electric-Vehicle Startup - WSJ,Recent exits include the heads of body engineering and parts purchasing,"Several top executives at The departures, confirmed by a Rivian spokeswoman, are the latest developments in what has been a challenging period for Rivian, which has been rolling out its first all-electric models but last year  25,000 vehicles. The company said it was off its goal by about 700 vehicles in part because of . Rivians stock has also tumbled since its  in November 2021, down roughly 79% through Tuesdays close. The executives who have left were some of Rivians longer-tenured employees. Among them is Randy Frank, vice president of body and interior engineering, and Steve Gawronski, the vice president in charge of parts purchasing. Both had departed around the beginning of this year. Mr. Frank joined Rivian in 2019 from  Co. Mr. Gawronski joined in 2018 from the autonomous vehicle startup Zoox.Another early employee, Patrick Hunt, a senior director in the strategy team, left the company late last year. Mr. Hunt joined Rivian in 2015.Rivians general counsel, Neil Sitron, departed in September after 4½ years with the company, which was founded in 2009.The Rivian spokeswoman said the company wants to ensure the startup has the talent and staff it needs to ramp up production. The company declined to comment on the individual circumstances of the departures. Efforts to reach the former employees werent immediately successful.""We continue to attract world class talent to our company as our business needs change,"" she said.The departures mark the latest shake-up at the top of Rivian, which  to oversee the companys manufacturing operations. The companys first full year of factory production was marred by  and difficulties getting the .Tim Fallon, former head of  Co.s factory in Canton, Miss., was hired in early 2022 to run Rivians sole factory in Normal, Ill.In June, Rivian hired Frank Klein as chief operating officer, from contract manufacturer .In a November email to employees reviewed by the Journal, Mr. Klein wrote that with Mr. Gawronskis exit, the company was taking the opportunity to make some organizational changes to ensure it can support the increased complexity that the group will handle in coming years.Mr. Klein added Rivian was reorganizing its supply-chain management, putting one vice president in charge of the supply chain and logistics, and another in charge of parts procurement.He also announced that Rivian had hired Andreas Reutter from tool maker  Inc. to oversee Rivians supply-chain logistics.The changes at the top of Rivian come as it attempts to transform from an upstart looking to raise capital to a mass manufacturer with ambitions to become one of the worlds largest auto makers.Its first all-electric models, the R1T pickup truck and R1S sport-utility vehicle, are relatively new. The company has only been building cars at its Illinois factory since late 2021. Before then, it had never built or sold a single vehicle for retail. As part of its expansion, Rivian went on a hiring spree, growing rapidly from about 1,200 workers in 2019 to around 14,000 employees by the summer of last year and has only recently begun creating positions that exist at many companies.In April, Anisa Kamadoli Costa was hired as chief sustainability officer from jewelry maker Tiffany Inc. In October, Rivian hired a former Capital One Financial Corp. executive, Diane Lye, as its first chief information officer.As Rivian has struggled to increase factory output, it has come under pressure to trim spending. Last summer, the company  and cut spending on many of its programs. The company became focused on bringing production of its current set of vehicles up to speed. It also makes an electric delivery van that it sells to Amazon.com Inc. In an example of the young car makers shifting priorities, Rivian suspended negotiations with Mercedes-Benz AG over a proposed van partnership in Europe, which had been an expansion target for Chief Executive RJ Scaringe. Rivian said the decision came after re-evaluating its opportunities for growth.The company reported a net loss of "

James Comer (R., Ky.), the panels chairman, wrote Tuesday in a letter to the White House requesting it provide by Jan. 24 copies of all papers taken from Mr. Bidens former office, a list of those who had access to the office and communications between various departments and the White House about the documents.Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement Tuesday: ""We expect to be briefed on what happened.""Rep. Mike Turner (R., Ohio), who is expected to become chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on Tuesday  that Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, review and assess any damage caused after the discovery of the classified documents and provide a classified briefing on the findings.CBS News reported on Monday evening that classified materials were found Nov. 2 at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, where Mr. Biden kept an office after his tenure as vice president, and turned over to the National Archives the following day. At least a dozen documents with classification markings were turned over to the archives, according to people familiar with an inquiry launched by the Justice Department. The White House released a statement Monday evening from one of Mr. Bidens attorneys confirming details of the discovery, more than two months after it occurred. Mr. Biden addressed the documents for the first time at a press conference Tuesday in Mexico City, where he is attending the North American Leaders Summit. ""People know I take classified documents, classified information seriously,"" Mr. Biden said.He said the documents were found in a box in a locked part of an office that his lawyers were clearing out. ""I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office,"" Mr. Biden said.The president said he doesnt know what the documents contain and he hasnt asked. He said that his lawyers are cooperating fully with a review of the papers, which he said should be concluded shortly.In response to questions Tuesday from The Wall Street Journal about why the administration didnt disclose the discovery sooner, White House spokesman Ian Sams said: ""This is an ongoing process under review by DOJ, so we are going to be limited in what we can say at this time. But we are committed to doing this the right way, and we will provide further details when and as appropriate.""After the matter was referred to the Justice Department, officials there and at the Federal Bureau of Investigation decided not to assign an inquiry to the DOJ section that normally investigates cases involving the potential mishandling of classified information-which  the hundreds of classified and other government documents found at former President Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort. They moved instead to keep the two probes separate, according to people familiar with the matter.Within days, the people said, Attorney General Merrick Garland settled on John Lausch, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, who had been appointed by Mr. Trump and remained in that post after Mr. Bidens inauguration to oversee sensitive public corruption investigations under way. Mr. Lausch is reviewing the documents and advising the attorney general how to proceed, including whether to appoint a special counsel.Mr. Lausch has already briefed Mr. Garland more than once and his review is entering its final stages, one of the people said.The discovery of the documents adds to topics that  now that they control the House and possess subpoena power. The White House has already been girding for investigations on the administrations handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr. Bidens son Hunters business dealings and immigration policies. The request from Mr. Warner, who has been a frequent Biden ally, underlines the bipartisan interest in learning more about the documents and will potentially make it more difficult for the White House to brush off congressional questions as partisan inquiries. Mr. Warner said he also wants to know more about what happened with classified documents found at Mr. Trumps home.Republicans also focused Tuesday on what they view as different treatment for Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, who was found to be in possession of classified material after leaving office. After months of less intrusive efforts to secure the documents, the FBI executed a search warrant at  in August. The documents seized there have been the subject of a protracted legal fight.House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R., La.), at his first news conference in his new role, said that Mr. Biden should face more media attention for holding the documents. ""For years when Vice President Biden left office, it looks like he took classified documents with him and he was very critical of President Trump,"" said Mr. Scalise. According to the White House account, the documents were found in a locked cabinet by the presidents personal lawyers as they were moving Mr. Bidens items out of the offices. Mr. Biden used the space from mid-2017 until he started his presidential campaign, the statement said. Mr. Bidens lawyers notified the National Archives the same day they found the documents and they were handed over to the archives the following day, according to the White House account. A National Archives spokesperson declined to comment.Mr. Comer on Tuesday also formally requested information from the National Archives, including communications between the archives, White House aides and Department of Justice officials. The request is part of an effort by his committee to determine if there is a ""political bias"" at the archives, according to a .Some Democrats defended Mr. Biden on Tuesday, pushing back on the notion of disparate treatment. ""The president is handling it the way he should,"" said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.), the chair of the House Democratic caucus. ""This is Republicans hypocrisy at its finest,"" he said, adding that, when law-enforcement officials found documents at Mr. Trumps property, Republicans played down the news. Current and former law-enforcement officials said there are some similarities between the Biden review and the Justice Departments investigation of classified documents at Mr. Trumps Mar-a-Lago home, including that sensitive national-security information was discovered somewhere it shouldnt be. But they also cited differences, namely the smaller volume of documents at issue and that Mr. Bidens personal attorneys found the documents and voluntarily notified the National Archives and Justice Department, as well as the smaller volume of documents at issue. The officials said situations such as the one involving Mr. Bidens office are often handled with internal discipline or sanctions rather than criminally because prosecuting someone for mishandling classified information requires prosecutors to show they intended to or recklessly removed documents from their proper place. No charges have been filed in connection with the Mar-a-Lago documents, and Mr. Trump has denounced the FBIs criminal investigation as a ""witch hunt.""Mr. Lausch was earlier tapped during the Trump administration to respond to Republican demands for documents on the FBIs handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, after Republicans accused officials of slow-walking their release.""Attorney General Garland wants to appear as though he is staying out of the politics of it,"" said John Huber, a former U.S. attorney in Utah. He was similarly appointed by Mr. Trumps first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to review Republican allegations against the FBI and Justice Department, including that employees were biased during their now-closed probe of Mrs. Clintons use of a private email server. Mr. Lausch ""is not a political animal. He is a prosecutor, he follows the evidence, and he seeks the interest of justice,"" Mr. Huber said.-Write to Annie Linskey at "

The former president had previously declined to concede that he had lost the October presidential election to Mr. da Silva but has condemned Sundays riots.Mr. Bolsonaro has been in the Orlando, Fla., area since the end of December, just before the leftist Mr. da Silva took office.Mr. Torres, who had previously said he was on a family holiday outside of Brazil, said on Twitter that he would return to Brazil and turn himself in.""I believe in the Brazilian justice system and in the strength of the institutions. I am certain that the truth will prevail,"" he said.

The army didnt rise up against Mr. da Silva. But the president blamed the military police, who answer to Brasílias local government, for not preventing the violence and vandalism. As authorities aim to determine who paid for a convoy of some 40 buses and other costs to transport Mr. Bolsonaros supporters to Brasília, they have turned their attention to the countrys wealthy farming belt where Mr. Bolsonaro .Farming associations have released a series of statements to condemn Sundays attacks. Brazils Agribusiness Association called the violence ""unreasonable, illegal and unacceptable"" and that ""agribusiness defends peaceful solutions."" Leading associations didnt respond to calls seeking comment on whether agribusinesses funded the bus convoy.Bolsonaro supporters who participated in the protests said that they came determined to see Mr. da Silva ousted.

Exports of both gas and crude are hitting new highs, easily outpacing overseas sales of aircraft, pharmaceuticals, food and cars.  rose 80% last year. The Biden administration has , but oil and gas companies have tapped the nations vast private shale reserves to drive production higher.As surging global demand for U.S. oil and gas has fueled high profit margins for producers, Mr. Biden has accused them of profiteering during a crisis. They take a different lesson from their fortune. ""Whats really happened is the world has realized there is a need for hydrocarbons in energy policy,"" said Domenic DellOsso, Chesapeakes chief executive.Chesapeake recently put a seventh drilling rig to work in the Haynesville basin, a giant natural-gas field straddling east Texas and northwest Louisiana that has also known booms in the past. In all, 69 drilling rigs were operating there in early January, compared with 32 in the summer of 2020. The local economy is cashing in.This boom is different from earlier ones.

In addition, their shareholders are insisting they return more of their profit to investors instead of using it to expand. Its a strategy that has positioned them to better handle swings in commodity prices, executives and analysts say. Another difference: The windfall for producers is largely coming from exports, which limits the extent to which the increased production translates into lower prices for American consumers. recently pushed natural-gas prices under Among the reasons: There isnt enough pipeline capacity to send more gas from Appalachias gas fields to populous areas such as the Northeast.

Competitor  Inc., majority-owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, has also said it was drilling more there.Chesapeake, co-founded in 1989 by the charismatic wildcatter Aubrey McClendon, was among the first operators to recognize that horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing could unlock troves of natural gas.As the company drew gas from tight shale formations in Louisiana, Texas and Appalachia, it also took on billions of dollars of debt to build a position of millions of acres on which it leased mineral rights. Other producers followed, so that by early 2011 more than 160 drilling rigs dotted the Haynesville, bringing prosperity to a historically poor area.Then, a series of disasters struck. Overproduction drove down gas prices, prompting Chesapeake to further diversify its production mix to include crude oil in Texas and Oklahoma, and slash gas drilling. Other producers also , an economic whiplash for the small businesses catering to the drillers.Activist investors including Carl Icahn took issue with Mr. McClendons risk-taking and free-spending ways, and  in 2013. Three years later, Mr. McClendon , a day after being indicted on federal price-fixing charges, which he denied. No link was found between the death and the indictment.Gas prices slightly  but slumped again going into the pandemic, sending Chesapeake and dozens of others into bankruptcy court.Behind the companys push back into the Haynesville now is a bet that the U.S. and the rest of the world wont be able to unwind quickly their dependence on fossil fuels, and especially on natural gas, which many in the industry say could be a bridge to a future in which renewables dominate.""If were going to shift away from fossil fuels, we need to identify the exit strategy, we cant just veer off the road."" said Timothy Fitzgerald, a Texas Tech economics professor who was an energy adviser to former President . When Chesapeake emerged from bankruptcy in early 2021, management eschewed growth and put priority on cash generation and investor payouts, said Mr. DellOsso-a strategy that the large debt loads had made impossible in years past. Chesapeake reduced its debt outstanding by In 2021, the company acquired Vine Energy Inc., getting hold of additional gas assets in the Haynesville. In August 2022, Chesapeake disclosed a 36-month agreement to supply 300 million cubic feet a day of gas to Golden Pass LNG, an export terminal on the Gulf Coast that is due to come online in 2024.The U.S. as a whole is on track to double exports of LNG to nearly 24 billion cubic feet a day by 2030, according to SThe production increases, while good for controlling the U.S. trade deficit, mostly failed to cut domestic energy costs until the recent warm temperatures suppressed heating-fuel demand. Drillers could produce more natural gas for domestic consumption, but there arent enough pipelines for new volumes, and the gas-delivery system is fragmented,  supplies. Local  has killed projects to ferry gas from Appalachia to markets farther east, contributing to electricity prices in New England that are typically higher than on the Gulf Coast.A growing interconnectedness between U.S. natural-gas production and global gas markets means that the supply is fetching higher international prices. Domestic prices are unlikely to return to prepandemic lows of less than Chesapeake has returned to its roots with restrained ambitions. Its capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2022 totaled Investors have been demanding returns such as dividends and buybacks  over growth from an industry with uncertain long-term prospects. ""That doesnt mean they wont let them drill, but they will prioritize return of capital,"" said Robert Kaplan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.Analysts expect the LNG trade to continue to grow, with several new export terminals expected to be built.

The registration documents filed this week with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation cover facilities to make and test batteries and other aspects of making its vehicles. Tesla produces the Model Y crossover vehicle in Texas and has said it plans to begin building its pickup truck, known as the Cybertruck, at the plant this year. It currently has capacity to make more than 250,000 vehicles a year at the facility, the company has said. Tesla didnt immediately respond to a request for comment on the new construction projects.Chief Executive  lastyear said the company might open  to increase production to meet its goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of the decade. The company  for a new factory, Mr. Musk said last month, without providing detail. ""We are applying capital at pretty close to the fastest rate we can spend capital and not be wasteful,"" he said.Tesla last week reported vehicle deliveries for 2022 that . Those estimates had already come down after the car maker signaled in October it  than it had originally targeted. Those numbers, coupled with  to get buyers to take delivery of vehicles before year-end, have spurred investor concerns that demand for its vehicles may be softening.Teslas stock just closed out , slumping 65%, amid demand concerns,  that Mr. Musks takeover of Twitter Inc. in October was distracting the billionaire from running the car company and other factors.Tesla is also facing more competition in the electric-vehicle market as more traditional car companies enter the space. Despite the challenges, including temporary production disruptions at its China factory due to Covid-19 outbreaks, Tesla increased vehicle deliveries last year by 40% from the year prior, handing over around 1.31 million vehicles.

9,2023-01-10,Californias Newsom Proposes Budget Cuts as State Faces $22.5 Billion Deficit - WSJ,"Governors budget plan includes $297 billion in spending, down $11 billion from the current year","California Gov. The If the shortfall materializes, it would be the states weakest revenues since the 2007-09 recession in 2008, according to the nonpartisan state Legislative Analysts Office. Californias projected deficit comes as many , in large part due to a deluge of federal funds over the past three years to fight the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, Texas announced a record An October analysis of the 15 largest states by Fitch Ratings showed California  experiencing year-over-year tax revenue declines. While the states employment has rebounded over the past 14 months, personal income tax withholding is down, in part because salary bonuses and initial public offerings have declined, according to the LAO, which forecast the deficit in November. That has led to a State law requires California to enact a balanced budget, and Mr. Newsom said he wants to do so-at least initially-without tapping tens of billions of dollars in budget reserves. Instead, Mr. Newsom intends to cover the shortfall with a patchwork of funding delays, spending reductions to programs and spending shifts. He also proposed trimming the states transportation and climate budgets.Environmental advocates say that would erase recent gains in funding for climate-change programs. ""Given how far behind we are, we have to sustain our commitment to climate action every year,"" said Mary Creasman, CEO of advocacy group California Environmental Voters in a statement. ""To further delay these investments will further compound the climate crisis and the cost of inaction will be far worse.""The governor sought to maintain recent reinforcements of the states social safety net, including the expansion of the states Medicaid program to all eligible residents, regardless of immigration status, as well as the states phase-in of universal preschool. Mr. Newsom also promised no proposed cuts to funding for , though he stressed that his administration would seek to tie distribution of those funds to greater local accountability.If state revenues come in higher than anticipated, or if officials receive additional federal funding theyre pursuing, other, Mr. Newsom said those cuts could be reversed.""Were not touching the reserves because we have a wait-and-see approach,"" Mr. Newsom told reporters at a briefing Tuesday morning.""We are in a very volatile moment."" The proposal represents the opening volley in a monthslong negotiation between Mr. Newsom and the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Leaders of both houses stopped short of directly addressing Mr. Newsoms proposed cuts. In a statement, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon signaled he might push for a deal that would dip into state budget reserves, saying they could be important for protecting ""Californias progressive investments.""Mr. Newsom said his proposal will give leaders the flexibility to tap those reserve accounts if the state experiences an even bigger downturn, or restore cuts if tax collections rebound. Mr. Newsom is expected to release an updated budget proposal in May, once the state revenue picture becomes clearer.According to the state Department of Finance, roughly 49% of personal income tax collected by California in 2020 came from just 1% of tax filers. Mr. Newsom opened the briefing Tuesday with a chart showing that capital gains as a percentage of personal income in California was down to 5.52% from nearly 10% in the 2022-2023 budget year. State income tax collections in 2022 were significantly lower than 2021, partly due to a lagging stock market.In 2020, Mr. Newsom signed a budget that anticipated a The budget deal struck between legislators and the governor last year spent much of the windfall on one-time programs.

10,2023-01-11,"George Pell, Powerful Australian Cardinal Who Was Charged, Acquitted of Child Sex Abuse, Dies at 81 - WSJ","Cardinal Pell had reached the top ranks of the Vatican, serving as adviser to Pope Francis","Cardinal ""It is with deep sadness that I can confirm His Eminence, George Cardinal Pell, passed away in Rome in the early hours of this morning,"" At his height, Cardinal Pell reached the top ranks of the Vatican, serving as its finance chief and an adviser to Pope Francis. A combative and polarizing figure, he drew powerful figures to his side and accumulated opponents to his steely adherence to doctrine as he rose through the churchs ranks.Allegations of child sex abuse dogged Cardinal Pell for years, ultimately taking him home to face trial in Australia, where he became the highest-ranking Catholic official to be convicted of such crimes at a time when accusations buffeted the church.But after he had served more than 12 months of a six-year prison sentence, the countrys top court reversed the conviction, and he was released. The Vatican publicly welcomed his acquittal and Cardinal Pell spent several months living at the Archdiocese of Sydney before leaving in September 2020 to return to the Vatican.George Pell was born in 1941 about 75 miles west of Melbourne, in the town of Ballarat, and showed an aptitude for sport and academia. Broad-shouldered and 6 feet 3 inches tall, the son of a pub-owning boxer was a natural at hard-hitting Australian rules football and was signed by one of Melbournes professional teams, the Richmond Tigers.But in 1960, he opted for the priesthood, attending a regional seminary before continuing his studies in Rome and later at the University of Oxford, where he earned a Ph.D. in church history.Father Pell served as a priest in various parishes, including in his hometown, before becoming rector of Corpus Christi College and auxiliary bishop of Melbourne. He was named archbishop of Melbourne by Pope John Paul II in 1996 and appointed archbishop of Sydney in 2001.In 2003, he was elevated to cardinal. In Rome, over a decade later, Pope Francis found in him a media-savvy prelate with financial experience, appointing him to run his newly established Secretariat for the Economy.Yet even as a figurehead for the Catholic church and one of the best-known faces of the church in Australia, Cardinal Pell attracted criticism for what some saw as coldness, including his reaction to widespread child sexual abuse by priests and brothers during his time in the Ballarat diocese. In 2016, he told a quasi-judicial inquiry into institutional abuse that he had been unaware of the issue. ""It was a sad story and of not much interest to me,"" he said, to opprobrium and disbelief from many survivors and commentators.He also drew staunch support, including from former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who wrote a glowing character reference ahead of Cardinal Pells sentencing after his December 2018 conviction.  Another Australian former prime minister, Tony Abbott, visited him in prison.A firm conservative even when the second Vatican council was liberalizing some aspects of the church in the 1960s, Cardinal Pells dedication to more traditional norms marked his rise. In 1985, as a rector at an archdiocesan seminary in Australia, he sought to reimpose on students 7 a.m. masses and a firm prayer schedule. With Pope John Paul II by then leading the church, he was appointed auxiliary bishop two years later.In the years after becoming archbishop of Melbourne in 1996, he faced criticism in Australia, including from some in the church, for his orthodox positions on matters including abortion drugs, stem-cell medical research and homosexuality.He also established in 1996 an official policy response to child sex abuse in the church. His so-called Melbourne Response, which offered some support for victims and capped compensation payments, would be brought up by lawyers in his defense during his trial two decades later.A church investigation when he was archbishop of Sydney, a position he held from 2001 to 2014, failed to substantiate allegations he groped an altar boy in 1961. A year later, Pope John Paul II appointed him a cardinal.The Melbourne Response added sting to his 2018 conviction-later overturned-when a jury agreed that while he was archbishop he attacked and sexually abused two 13-year-old choir boys in the Melbourne cathedral where he celebrated Mass most Sundays.Following the conviction, a court ruled that witness testimony wasnt strong enough to support separate charges against the cardinal of abuse of two minors in the 1980s. Prosecutors subsequently withdrew those charges.During his incarceration, Cardinal Pells position overseeing and investigating Vatican finances was taken up elsewhere. He was never restored to the role but, within hours of Australias highest court quashing his conviction on grounds of reasonable doubt, Pope Francis publicly prayed for all those suffering unjust sentences.He was immediately released from jail with his April 2020 acquittal, but an enduring image lingered with critics: that of Cardinal Pell as auxiliary bishop for Melbourne photographed in 1993 walking side-by-side with Gerald Ridsdale the day the disgraced priest pleaded guilty to 30 sex offenses against nine boys. It was a show of support that Cardinal Pell later said he regretted. He said he also regretted his earlier comments about the Ballarat diocese. Robb M. Stewart at  and Stuart Condie at "
