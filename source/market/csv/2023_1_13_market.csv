0,2023-01-12,Stocks Climb After Inflation Data - WSJ,"Federal Reserve appears poised for a smaller quarter-point interest-rate increase</h2>, <h2 class=""sc-jTzLTM jTnwvo"">We want to hear from you","U.S. stocks climbed Thursday after the latest inflation data showed cooling price pressures for the sixth consecutive month, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on track to slow its pace of interest-rate increases.The S&amp;P 500 added 13.56 points, or 0.3%, to 3983.17, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 216.96 points, or 0.6%, to 34189.97. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 69.43 points, or 0.6%, to 11001.10. The indexes bobbed between gains and losses early in the session before gaining steam midday.Consumer-price inflation slowed to 6.5% in December, down from 7.1% in November, the Labor Department said. Despite landing largely in line with economists expectations, one measure of services inflation-excluding energy services and the cost of owning or renting a home-offered encouragement that tighter monetary-policy is proving effective. So-called supercore inflation, flagged by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as especially important given its sensitivity to labor costs, rose at a 3% annualized rate, well below the pace seen last year. Many economists have noted it is normal to see a delay in housing prices falling substantially.In response to the data, traders grew more confident that the Fed is on course to slow its pace of tightening at its coming meeting. Wall Street widely expects the central bank to raise its benchmark rate target by a quarter of a percentage point to a range between 4.5% and 4.75% on Feb. 1.The data was ""a mixed bag when you dig into the nuance,"" said Andrew Patterson, senior economist at Vanguard. Mr. Patterson added he will be closely watching Fed officials comments between now and the end of the month to get a better sense of where the Fed might be headed.Thursdays rally extends the S&amp;P 500s gains for the month to 3.7%. Energy stocks fared best of the indexs 11 sectors, rising 1.9% alongside higher oil prices. Brent crude-oil futures gained 1.6% to $84.03 a barrel.Investors scooped up U.S. Treasurys, lifting bond prices and weighing on yields. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped to 3.446% from 3.554% late Wednesday, while the yield on the two-year note-which is more sensitive to monetary-policy expectations-fell to 4.138% from 4.226%. Market-based expectations are for the Fed to cut rates by roughly a half-percentage point in the latter half of the year, according to derivatives prices via FactSet. Yet some policy makers have pushed back on the chance of any rate decreases in 2023, saying borrowing costs will have to stay high for some time to bring down inflation.""The market is battling against them,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank. ""Its easing financial conditions,"" when Fed officials want the opposite, he said.Global investors wagered that a less-aggressive Fed would be a boon for assets that had suffered from the support rising rates provided for the dollar.The yen rose 2.4% against the greenback, supported by speculation that the Bank of Japan could retreat from its ultra-lenient monetary policy. Front-month gold futures jumped 1.1% to $1895.50 a troy ounce, their highest close since April 2022. The dollar extended recent declines. The WSJ Dollar Index dropped 0.9% to its lowest level since June 2022. Speculators have piled into bets against the dollar and in favor of gold lately, hoping for a reversal of 2022s performances.Options traders took a breath of fresh air after the print, seeing fewer catalysts to jostle stocks on the horizon. The Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, extended its longest lull since late 2021 by falling below 20-a level typically seen as signifying lack of worry or complacency-to 18.83. Elsewhere, airline stocks received a boost from American Airlines improved earnings guidance, which sent shares up $1.49, or 9.7%, to $16.83. Overseas markets were broadly higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 extended its strong start to the year, rising 0.6%. In Asia, Hong Kongs Hang Seng rose 0.4%. Japans Nikkei 225 was close to flat, and the Shanghai Composite Index rose less than 0.1%.Write to Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com, Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com",0
1,2023-01-12,The Markets Are Locked in a Game of Chicken With the Fed - WSJ,Investors are betting the Fed will cut interest rates as early as the second half of the year. The central bank says otherwise.,"The Federal Reserve says it is too early to think about cutting interest rates this year. Investors are growing more convinced that is exactly what the central bank is going to do.The clash between investors hopes and Fed policy, and how it ultimately resolves, is shaping up to be one of the biggest question marks for financial markets in 2023.Many money managers predict inflation has peaked, and that price pressures will fall so fast that the Fed takes back some of its interest-rate increases by the end of the year, as it did in 2019 just seven months after its last hike.Fed officials have been hammering a different message: This time will be different because inflation is much higher.The Labor Department said Thursday that its consumer-price index, which measures what consumers pay for goods and services, rose 6.5% in December from a year earlier. That marked its slowest pace since October 2021, and its sixth consecutive monthly decline. Last weeks jobs report also showed wage growth cooled, with average hourly earnings rising at the slowest pace since mid-2021.Evidence that inflation is pulling back has fueled bets that the Fed will cut rates as early as the second half of the year. Traders in interest-rate derivatives markets see a 90% chance that the Fed lifts rates two more times this year, to around 4.9% by March, according to CME Group. They see a 60% chance that the Fed then cuts rates at least once by December.At their meeting last month, Fed officials projected interest rates will continue rising through the spring, to around 5.1%. None of them penciled in cuts this year. They have generally signaled a somewhat more aggressive path for interest rates either because they are less optimistic than investors, who see a speedier slowdown in inflation this year, or because they are less pessimistic about the probability of a serious recession.""To be honest with you, I dont quite know why markets are so optimistic about inflation,"" said San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly after the Feds meeting last month. ""I think of them as priced for perfection,"" she said.The Fed and many investors agree that inflation will keep declining this year as supply-chain bottlenecks abate and as housing costs slow down after soaring over the past two years. But Fed officials are nervous that the labor markets strength could sustain wage growth that keeps inflation, as measured by a separate gauge, above their 2% target.Fed officials, Ms. Daly said, ""dont have the luxury of pricing for perfectionâ€¦. We have to imagine what the risks to inflation are.""One of her colleagues, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, echoed that point after Thursdays report was released. ""It could be that inflation starts to go in the other direction again, and then the Fed would have to react to that,"" he said during a webinar. ""I dont think theres enough pricing being put on that possibility.""Investors who are counting on interest rates falling are at risk of being burned if they wind up being wrong.The S&amp;P 500 has risen 11% from its October low, with much of the gains being attributed to bets that the Fed will pivot from raising rates to cutting them some time this year. Government bonds have also retraced some losses after a brutal 2022. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 3.446% Thursday, compared with its October peak of 4.231%. Yields fall as bond prices rise.Several banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., UBS Group AG, and Deutsche Bank AG, are expecting U.S. stocks to post gains this year. But others are cautioning the market could suffer double-digit percentage declines yet again, especially if Fed policy winds up being tougher than investors anticipate, which in turn could cause the economy to slow down more than investors expect.What explains the disconnect between the Fed and much of Wall Street?""It is very simple: The market has a very different view on inflation. It thinks inflation is going to fall much faster than the Fed does,"" said Mark Cabana, the head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Bank of America Corp.In addition, there are important technical differences in what the Feds quarterly economic and interest-rate projections show relative to what investors anticipate based on readings of interest-rate futures markets.The Feds projections represent what every individual Fed official thinks should happen to interest rates under their modal, or most likely, expectation for the economy. But those projections only reveal how the Fed is likely to respond under one general set of circumstances. Market participants, on the other hand, can make probability-weighted bets in interest-rate futures markets that better take into account different economic scenarios.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has at times emphasized the limitations of the Feds projections.""When uncertainty around the outlook is unusually high, I dutifully write down what I see as the appropriate funds rate path in the most likely scenario, but I do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted, for what is most likely may not be particularly likely,"" he said in 2019.The past year served as a cautionary tale for many investors, with inflation and interest rates racing far higher than most foresaw. ""Think about what the Fed and the market was projecting a year ago,"" said Joe Amato, president of Neuberger Berman Group.The way stocks have bounced back the past few months suggests ""theres a false sense of precision from the equity markets"" on where rates are headed, he said.Many investors also appear to be reluctant to take the Fed at its word, said Sam Lynton-Brown, head of global macro strategy at BNP Paribas SA.""The market has learned that forward guidance for central banks, at a point when theyre data-dependent and the data are volatile, doesnt hold much credibility,"" said Mr. Lynton-Brown. ""Its all about what the data shows,"" and specifically, about whether or not the data suggest inflation will be able to quickly fall to the Feds 2% target, he said. (Mr. Lynton-Brown doesnt believe that will be the case.)The gap between Wall Streets expectations and Fed talk may also stem in part from central bankers reluctance to come across as too optimistic in public.The Fed believes its policies to slow demand and combat inflation work by tightening financial conditions, such as by raising borrowing costs or lowering stock prices and other asset values. Any market rallies that ease financial conditions could potentially hinder officials effort to restrain hiring or wage growth.""The minute the Fed acknowledges inflation isnt a problem anymore, markets will just speed higher,"" which would prolong the Feds job, said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global.At the end of the day, what may matter most for markets isnt how high the Fed raises rates, but how well the economy is able to hold up over the coming year.For instance, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says if the U.S. narrowly avoids recession, as it expects it will, it sees stocks ending the year just a touch higher. If the economy were to go into recession, Goldman sees earnings growth sliding-in which case, the S&amp;P 500 could fall about 20%, a far different outcome.Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Nick Timiraos at Nick.Timiraos@wsj.com",1
2,2023-01-12,ConocoPhillips in Talks to Sell Venezuelan Oil in U.S. to Recover Billions It Is Owed - WSJ,"The Houston-based oil company has had preliminary discussions with Venezuelas state oil firm, PdVSA","ConocoPhillips, which abandoned Venezuela after its assets were nationalized in 2007, is now open to a deal to sell the countrys oil in the U.S. as a way to recover the close to $10 billion it is owed by Venezuela, according to people familiar with discussions between the company and Venezuela representatives.In what are preliminary talks between ConocoPhillips and national oil company PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela SA, the two sides are looking at a proposal that could allow the Houston-based company to load, transport and sell Venezuelas oil in the U.S. on behalf of PdVSA, as the state oil company is known. This would give ConocoPhillips a chance to recover the money it lost in the country and help the U.S. meet its energy needs, the people said.The arrangement would help Venezuela end the commercial isolation that was caused by U.S. sanctions leveled against the oil industry in 2019, and further open the U.S. market to its crude. The U.S. had historically been Venezuelas largest oil market until the sanctions, with several big Gulf Coast refineries designed to run its heavy crude. But a sharp yearslong fall in Venezuelan production curbed supply. Then sanctions, imposed by the U.S. in response to human rights violations and democratic backsliding, broke off trade.ConocoPhillips, which has a license from the U.S. Treasury Department to negotiate debt recovery with PdVSA, declined to discuss any deal with PdVSA.""Regarding PdVSA recovery efforts, ConocoPhillips is committed to pursuing all available legal avenues to protect our rights and obtain a full and fair recovery of the awards in recognition of our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders,"" ConocoPhillips said.In a statement, the State Department didnt answer questions about ConocoPhillips, instead saying U.S. policy is to ""implement and enforce our Venezuela sanctions in support of a return to democracy in Venezuela.""The possibility of a deal between PdVSA and ConocoPhillips comes after the Biden administration issued a license in November to Chevron Corp. to restart oil production and exports from existing joint ventures with PdVSA, marking the first significant easing of U.S. sanctions against Venezuela President NicolÃ¡s Maduros government. The Trump administration had barred most Western companies from operating in Venezuela in an effort to dislodge Mr. Maduro from power. He survived with the help of China, Russia and Iran.Now, with Chevron having won a license and starting to load crude, those companies are trying to resume suspended production or expand the limited operations they have maintained in Venezuela.At least a handful of oil-and-gas companies are exploring Venezuelan deals and holding talks with PdVSA, some of which are seeking authorization from the U.S. State and Treasury departments in order to negotiate, according to people close to some of the firms. Among those pressing for U.S. approval to expand operations in Venezuela are Spains Repsol SA and Italys Eni SpA, which produce modest amounts of gas off Venezuelas coast. Representatives for the two companies didnt immediately respond to requests for comments.Elliott Abrams, who served as envoy to Venezuela in the Trump administration, says those European companies want fair treatment from U.S. regulators.""The question is, why is that fair if youre Repsol [or] Eni?"" Mr. Abrams said. ""Ultimately these other companies are going to have to be treated equally by the Biden administration.""In exchange for the Chevron license, Venezuela agreed to discuss a path to free and fair elections in 2024 with the opposition and to clear the way for a $3 billion United Nations-administered humanitarian aid program, which has yet to be implemented.Chevron chose to stay in Venezuela despite the wave of expropriations under Mr. Maduros predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, who died in 2013.ConocoPhillips, in contrast, pulled out and later won nearly $10 billion in total international arbitration awards against the Venezuelan state and PdVSA over the seizure of its oil projects.The awards make ConocoPhillips the largest private-sector creditor of Venezuela. For years, the company has aggressively pursued enforcement of its claims by imposing liens on Venezuelan assets around the world. Under a 2018 settlement agreement for a $2 billion award, PdVSA paid ConocoPhillips $774 million before halting payments, blaming sanctions.Venezuela is ""totally ready to take steps toward a process of normalization of diplomatic, consular and political relations"" with Washington, Mr. Maduro said in a recent interview on state television.ConocoPhillips isnt considering going back into Venezuela to pump oil, at least for now, despite opportunities floated by PdVSA, including gas deals, according to the people familiar with the talks. As things stand, Venezuela only has a limited volume of oil to export unless it can attract more investment to fix long-neglected oil fields, pipelines and port infrastructure.",2
3,2023-01-12,U.S. Inflation Slowed for Sixth Straight Month in December - WSJ,Consumer-price index rose 6.5% last month from a year earlier,"U.S. inflation eased in December for the sixth straight month following a mid-2022 peak as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and the economy showed signs of cooling.The consumer-price index, a measurement of what consumers pay for goods and services, rose 6.5% last month from a year earlier, down from 7.1% in November and well below a 9.1% peak in June.Core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, climbed 5.7% in December from a year earlier, easing from a 6% gain in November. Many economists see increases in core CPI as a better signal of future inflation than the overall CPI. Core prices increased at a 3.1% annualized rate in the three months ended in December, the slowest pace in more than a year and down from 7.9% in June.The figures added to signs that inflation is turning a corner following last years surge. They also likely keep the Fed on track to reduce the size of interest-rate increases to a quarter-percentage-point at their meeting that concludes on Feb. 1, down from a half-percentage point increase in December.U.S. stocks climbed Thursday and investors bought U.S. Treasurys, lifting bond prices and weighing on yields. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, or 217 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also rose 0.6%.Easing inflation follows several signs that U.S. economic activity cooled in late 2022. U.S. imports and exports fell in November from October, while retail sales, manufacturing output and home sales all declined. Job and wage growth slowed in December, though the labor market remained tight with historically low claims for unemployment insurance at the start of the year.""The December CPI report was welcome good news after a very bad patch for inflation,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. He said consumers are getting relief from lower gasoline prices and moderating food prices, as well as declining prices for other goods.On a monthly basis, the CPI fell 0.1% in December, due to sharply falling energy prices. That compared with a gain of 0.1% in November and 0.4% in October. Food-price increases also slowed last month. Core CPI rose 0.3% in December, up from Novembers 0.2% rise but down from 0.6% increases in August and September.Goods prices, a key driver of inflation over the past year and a half, fell for the third straight month in December as prices fell for products such as autos, computers and sporting goods.Improving supply chains and reduced demand have relieved price pressures on goods, but services prices continued to climb in part because of wage gains in a tight labor market.Some economists worry that still-high wage growth could keep consumers flush with cash and companies eager to raise prices to compensate, holding inflation above the Feds 2% target.""Taming services inflation will be the Feds biggest challenge this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.Shelter prices rose 7.5% in December from a year earlier, the Labor Department said, and a broader measure of services prices that excludes utilities rose 7% during the same period. Both increases were the biggest since 1982.Daycare and preschool prices rose 5.4% in December from a year earlier, the biggest increase since 2006, while those for home-health care increased 6.1% in the same period. Hospital services prices, meanwhile, jumped 1.5% in December from the prior month, the sharpest monthly increase since 2015.Inflation remained high across the globe in November, though it abated during the month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday. Consumer prices across the Group of 20 largest economies-which contribute four-fifths of economic output worldwide-rose 9% from a year earlier in November, down from Octobers 9.5% increase, the first drop in the G-20 inflation rate since August 2021.Prices rose sharply in 2021 as the U.S. economy rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic, powered by pent-up consumer spending that got a boost from low interest rates and government stimulus. Snarled supply chains fueled higher prices for many goods. Russias invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 also tightened supplies of energy and other commodities, further stoking inflation worldwide.Inflation pressures on goods dissipated last summer as supply chains improved and energy prices fell. Shipping costs from China to the West Coast are near prepandemic levels. Gasoline prices have declined, with the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline at $3.27 a gallon on Thursday, down about 50 cents a gallon from mid-November, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider. Gasoline prices peaked in mid-June at a record $5.02 a gallon.""Logistics prices have also slowed materially, shipping costs are back to where they were pre-Covid,"" said Jake Oubina, senior economist at Piper Sandler. ""The alleviation on the cost side is creating the wherewithal to discount more aggressively as we head into 2023.""The clearest impact of Fed tightening so far is in the housing market. Existing-home sales fell in November for a 10th straight month as high mortgage rates boosted buyers costs.Ian Snowden, a 33-year-old tech salesman, said the shift to remote work after the pandemic hit allowed him to move to Asheville, N.C., where he has easy access to hiking, fishing and other outdoor activities.The move proved expensive, though. After losing out to cash buyers in bids for existing homes, Mr. Snowden signed a contract in September 2021 to buy a newly constructed property. By the time his home was completed the following June, mortgage rates had doubled. On top of that, the construction company told him that he was on the hook for an extra $25,000 to offset unexpectedly high costs for concrete, labor and other items-or he could back out of the contract.At that point, Mr. Snowden said, he was already selling his old house and had made plans to move, so he wasnt going to back out. ""So much was already in motion,"" he said. Between the higher mortgage rates and the additional costs, the monthly mortgage payment increased $200, he said.Austen Hufford contributed to this article.",3
4,,Sam Bankman-Fried Resurfaces With Fresh Defense of FTX Collapse on Substack,"Stock Market Today, Jan. 12: Stocks Close Higher After CPI Data","Sam Bankman-Fried is back online, using a new public forum to rally his defense.The founder of FTX launched ""SBFs Substack"" on Thursday, giving his take on the events leading to the crypto exchanges collapse. Mr. Bankman-Fried is under house arrest at his parents California home as he faces federal fraud charges. He has pleaded not guilty.""I didnt steal funds, and I certainly didnt stash billions away,"" he wrote in a post.His arguments, which appear to be an outline of his coming legal defense, mirror those Mr. Bankman-Fried posted on Twitter in the weeks before his arrest.Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote on his Substack:He compared FTX and Alamedas problems to those of Credit Suisse, whose shares plummeted last fall. ""At the end of the day, its run on the bank fell short. FTXs didnt.""Some of his assertions contradict federal prosecutors and Mr. Bankman-Frieds own former associates. At the end of the post, Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote, ""All of which is to say: no funds were stolen. Alameda lost money due to a market crash it was not adequately hedged for.""The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that FTX lent billions of dollars' worth of customer assets to fund risky bets by Alameda, and that the hedge fund's chief executive and senior FTX officials knew about that decision to send user funds to Alameda.The collapse of Mr. Bankman-Frieds hedge fund, Alameda Research, stemmed from a broad crypto market meltdown.He didn't run Alameda for the last few years.FTX could have raised fresh investor cash and made customers whole if it wasnt forced into bankruptcy.Alamedas insolvency stemmed from failure to hedge its positions and actions by rival exchange Binance.Alamedas contagion spread to FTX.",4
5,2023-01-13,SEC Sues Crypto Firms Genesis and Gemini Over Lending Product - WSJ,"The program, called Gemini Earn, allegedly violated investor-protection laws","WASHINGTON-The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday sued Genesis Global Capital LLC and Gemini Trust Company LLC over a $900 million crypto-lending program that allegedly violated investor-protection laws.The SEC filed its civil lawsuit in Manhattan federal court alleging that Genesis should have registered the product, which would have required providing clients with detailed financial disclosures. The companies began marketing the program to individual investors in February 2021 and raised billions of dollars worth of crypto assets from hundreds of thousands of investors, the SEC said.Under the program, called Gemini Earn, customers of crypto exchange Gemini lent their crypto assets to crypto lender Genesis in exchange for interest payments as high as 8%. Gemini took a fee for arranging the loan, which sometimes reached as much as 4.29%, the SEC said.The two companies have been feuding since Genesis abruptly paused withdrawals from the program on Nov. 16 after it couldnt meet client redemption requests in the wake of crypto exchange FTXs collapse. At the time, Genesis held about $900 million in assets from 340,000 Gemini Earn customers, according to the SEC.The SECs lawsuit seeks fines and the return of profits that were illegally earned.""We look forward to defending ourselves against this manufactured parking ticket. And we will make sure this doesnt distract us from the important recovery work we are doing,"" Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said in a tweet in response to the SEC suit. A spokeswoman for Genesis didnt comment.Since Genesis paused redemptions, Gemini has banded together with other creditors of Genesis, saying it wants to find a way for the crypto lender to return owed assets.In recent days, Cameron Winklevoss, who co-founded Gemini with brother Tyler, has ratcheted up the pressure on Genesis and its parent company, Digital Currency Group. Cameron Winklevoss traded barbs with Barry Silbert, chief executive of DCG, on Twitter last week. Cameron Winklevoss accused Mr. Silbert of ""bad faith stall tactics,"" and called for Mr. Silberts removal as CEO of the firm in two recent open letters posted on Twitter. A DCG spokeswoman has called the Winklevoss letters a ""desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt.""Genesis laid off 30% of its staff last week and is considering filing for bankruptcy, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. The crypto lender suffered steep losses from loans it supplied to the now-defunct trading firm Alameda Research and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Both Alameda and Three Arrows filed for bankruptcy last year. Alameda is the sister trading firm of FTX.The lawsuit against Genesis and Gemini resembles another case that the SEC and several states filed over BlockFi Lending LLCs product, which allowed crypto traders to earn a yield for lending their digital assets. The SEC alleged that BlockFis interest-bearing accounts were securities and that the firm should have registered the product. BlockFi paid a $100 million fine to settle the allegations. The company didnt admit or deny wrongdoing.The newlawsuit is the second recentregulatory complaint filed against Gemini. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also sued the crypto exchange last year.The CFTC said in its civil case that Gemini misled regulators as part of an effort to gain approval for bitcoin futures in 2017. Gemini denied the CFTCs claims at the time and said it would fight the allegations in court. The litigation is ongoing.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com and Vicky Ge Huang at vicky.huang@wsj.com",5
6,2023-01-12,Activist Investor Nelson Peltz to Disneys New Board Chair: No Thanks - WSJ,Entertainment companys appointment of Nikes Mark Parker to Disney chairman puts a Bob Iger loyalist in control of succession,"Activist investor Nelson Peltz doesnt think the Walt Disney Co.s DIS <span class=""css-1hk2j0i-ChicletChange erm4ah13"">3.61%</span><span class=""css-jozwg9-Arrow erm4ah11""><span class=""css-1q7p60h-ArrowHiddenLabel erm4ah10"">increase; green up pointing triangle</span><svg height=""16"" viewbox=""0 0 16 16"" width=""16""><defs><path d=""M8.588 3.985l4.927 7.14-.506.86H3.02l-.534-.86 4.959-7.14z"" id=""arrow-down-filled-small_svg__a""></path></defs><use fill=""currentColor"" fill-rule=""evenodd"" transform=""rotate(-180 8.008 7.992)"" xlink:href=""#arrow-down-filled-small_svg__a""></use></svg></span> board leadership change will shift the direction of the company, saying the new chairman is little more than a rubber stamp for newly returned CEO Bob Iger, according to people familiar with the matter.On Thursday, Mr. Peltz and his hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP turned up the heat in their proxy battle, despite board changes the Walt Disney Co. made Wednesday in an effort to counter his push. Disney on Wednesday replaced its board chair Susan Arnold with Nike Inc. NKE <span class=""css-1hk2j0i-ChicletChange erm4ah13"">-0.04%</span><span class=""css-ule3a4-Arrow erm4ah11""><span class=""css-1q7p60h-ArrowHiddenLabel erm4ah10"">decrease; red down pointing triangle</span><svg height=""16"" viewbox=""0 0 16 16"" width=""16""><defs><path d=""M8.588 3.985l4.927 7.14-.506.86H3.02l-.534-.86 4.959-7.14z"" id=""arrow-down-filled-small_svg__a""></path></defs><use fill=""currentColor"" fill-rule=""evenodd"" transform=""rotate(-180 8.008 7.992)"" xlink:href=""#arrow-down-filled-small_svg__a""></use></svg></span> chairman Mark Parker, and assured investors that he would lead the search for the companys next chief executive.Mr. Peltz thinks Mr. Parker and the newly-returned Mr. Iger are too friendly for Mr. Parker to be truly objective, according to people familiar with Mr. Peltzs thinking. Mr. Peltz also thinks Mr. Parker has too many demands on his time and attention, given that he still serves as Nikes executive chairman, these people said.Wednesday night, the activist and his fund made their criticisms of Disneys performance public in an online presentation titled ""Restore the Magic"" followed by a proxy filing Thursday that detailed their assessment of a company in crisis due to what they describe as a series of self-inflicted wounds.They argued Disney has been hobbled by poor succession planning, ""over the top"" compensation, mismanagement of costs and flawed strategy. They criticized Disney for using its theme-parks revenue to subsidize its streaming losses and said Disneys acquisition of the 21st Century Fox Inc. assets put Disney in an unhealthy financial state. Foxs corporate sibling, News Corp, owns The Wall Street Journal.Disneys failure to persuade Mr. Peltz that the company is on the right track means that Mr. Iger faces a rockier road ahead in his first year back atop Disney, which already includes challenges such as a potential recession, a prolonged stock price slump, rising costs for content, potential layoffs and stiff competition in the streaming video business.It also highlights ongoing concerns among shareholders about Disneys leadership, strategy and succession plans. Six months ago, Disney fended off a challenge from another activist, Dan Loeb, who agreed to back off after the company appointed a director that Mr. Loeb had approved.Disney opposes placing Mr. Peltz on its board because the company thinks, in part, that the activist investor lacks experience in the media-and-entertainment space, according to people familiar with the companys thinking.The board also thinks that adding Mr. Peltz to its board would bring more disruption amid an already turbulent time for the company, as it navigates a new period with Mr. Iger back at the helm, people familiar with the matter said. Some shareholders voiced concerns about Disneys succession planning after Mr. Iger returned, the people said.Ms. Arnold retiring as chairwoman had been in the works with her 15-year term limit nearly up and wasnt meant to be a reaction to Mr. Peltzs campaign, the people said. Disneys bylaws limit nonmanagement directors to 15 total years on the board, after which they arent permitted to stand for re-election.Mr. Iger reclaimed the CEO spot at Disney in November, when the companys board fired Bob Chapek. The ouster came as Mr. Peltz was amassing Disney shares, and communicating with Mr. Chapek about his stake, according to Trians proxy materials.Mr. Peltzs fund has now amassed a more than $900 million stake, which will likely grow larger, according to people familiar with the matter. He said in the online presentation he doesnt want to replace Mr. Iger, but is seeking a board seat and wants a CEO named within two years.Disney said Wednesday that while members of its senior leadership team have engaged with Mr. Peltz numerous times over the past few months, the board is asking shareholders to vote against him at the coming annual meeting. Disney also asked shareholders to reinstate the current board of directors of the company-minus Ms. Arnold.In the presentation on Trians website, Mr. Peltzs fund highlighted what it described as mistakes made by the board, and compared Disneys shareholder returns to the broader market during the tenure of each director. Mr. Parkers seven years on the board have seen Disneys performance trail the S&amp;P 500 by 128 percentage points, a wider margin than for any other director, the presentation said.""There are still several current directors and members of management who oversaw and approved some of Disneys worst corporate governance and strategic failures,"" Trian wrote.Mr. Iger has long admired Mr. Parker as an executive andhas felt that Nike and Disney have similar leadership needs, according to people familiar with the matter. The two men have a close professional relationship, they said. Mr. Iger has told associates that he considers Mr. Parker, who in 1983 designed the Nike Pegasus running shoe, a ""creative executive"" and praised his steering of Nikes business toward a more digital-focused e-commerce model. The path tracks Disneys own pivot to streaming video and recent emphasis on smartphone apps and data-driven sales practices. The two men have also bonded over being fitness buffs, people familiar with the matter said.There are five other people who serve as board chairs at two companies simultaneously, according to governance research firm Equilar, Inc.""This is going to take an awful lot of work,"" said Charles Elson, founding director at the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Mr. Peltzs campaign is rooted in his belief that Disneys board and senior management have made a series of high-profile missteps over the last year. Mr. Iger has also criticized several of the Disney boards moves, according to people familiar with the matter.Last year, some Disney directors began to discuss whether Mr. Chapek could recover after a war of words with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over an education bill, according to people familiar with the matter. Some board members discussed appointing Mr. Parker as interim CEO, the people said.In early June, after Mr. Chapek fired a top deputy, Ms. Arnold released a statement saying that Mr. Chapek had the full support of the board. Later that month, the board renewed Mr. Chapeks contract through the end of 2024, over the objections of at least two directors who needed to be persuaded Mr. Chapek was still the right man for the job, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.Mr. Iger told friends at the time that he couldnt understand why Ms. Arnold was so unwavering in her support for Mr. Chapek, despite what he viewed as clear signs that Mr. Chapek wasnt leading Disney successfully, according to people familiar with the matter. Last summer, as the company veered into crisis, Mr. Peltz and his wife dined with Mr. Chapek and his wife at Disneyland Paris, where the activist investor told the then-CEO that he was interested in joining the board and offering a fresh perspective, according to Trians proxy materials.Mr. Peltz also told two other Disney directors, Oracle Corp. CEO Safra Catz and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. board member Amy Chang, that he wanted to join the board ""to help turn around the Company and drive long-term shareholder value,"" according to Trians proxy materials.Those discussions didnt go anywhere until early November, when Disneys share price plummeted following a weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report, according to Trians proxy materials. Mr. Peltz pounced, quickly accumulating more than $800 million worth of Disney stock. A few days later, he contacted Mr. Chapek to initiate a formal dialogue.Over the last week, Disney and Mr. Peltz have met to try to reach an agreement that would avoid a proxy fight, to no avail. Ms. Arnold called Mr. Peltz on Wednesday to offer him a view into the board, but not a seat on the board, and Mr. Peltz declined, according to Trians proxy materials.",6
7,2023-01-12,Climate Startup Removes Carbon From Open Air in Industry First - WSJ,Climeworks cashes in on new technology by selling carbon credits to Microsoft and others,"One of the most important technologies to address climate change got a boost Thursday when a startup said it pulled carbon dioxide from the open air and stored it underground. The company has cashed in on the effort, potentially creating a viable business model that could kick-start a new industry.Climeworks AG is a leader in the race to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using a process known as direct-air capture. Customers, including Microsoft Corp., paid a significant premium to buy carbon credits generated by Climeworks, allowing them to effectively offset their own emissions.Climeworks and others have long promised that using vacuum-like devices to pull in air, filter it and bury carbon underground can help mitigate environmental damage caused by human activities. This is the first time a company has actually done it at a meaningful scale using a third-party verified process.""We hope we are growing from a teenager to a grown-up in this industry,"" Christoph Gebald, co-chief executive of Climeworks, said in an interview.Founded in 2009, Climeworks is effectively carrying out what trees do by taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The process promises to store the carbon in the earth for thousands of years. The company makes money by removing the carbon on behalf of businesses that can claim they are becoming carbon neutral.Microsoft, e-commerce company Shopify Inc. and payments firm Stripe Inc. have prepaid or agreed to pay hundreds of dollars per credit, each of which represents one metric ton of carbon removed. Other carbon credits tied to projects such as keeping trees standing have often been criticized because the projects often dont reduce emissions as much as promised.Companies pay a premium, sometimes paying hundreds of times as much as they do for basic credits, for the credits from Climeworks because there is more certainty they remove carbon from the atmosphere. The companies are also willing to pay more to help jump-start the industry, hoping that costs decline rapidly.""This is an important inflection point in the development of direct-air capture,"" said Stacy Kauk, Shopifys head of sustainability. ""It isnt just science fiction. Its reality.""The promise of the technology has prompted established businesses such as Occidental Petroleum Corp. to develop their own direct-air capture strategies.Climeworks operates one of the worlds only operational direct-air capture plants in Iceland, which is capable of removing about 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of about 800 passenger cars. Other removals to this point had been done using methods such as burying carbon-rich plant material underground.Climeworks declined to say how much carbon it removed. Businesses globally have agreed to purchase credits equivalent to more than 700,000 metric tons of carbon removal from it and other companies, according to data provider CDR.fyi. Scientists estimate billions of metric tons a year need to be removed annually by midcentury to avoid the worst effects of global warming.Bigger companies and investors are flocking to the industry. Occidental recently said it aims to increase the number of planned direct-air-capture facilities it operates to 100 from 70 by 2035, aided by bolstered tax credits that are part of the climate, health and spending legislation known as the Inflation Reduction Act.The tax credits are now up to $180 per metric ton of removal. Occidental is working with a startup on its first large facility in the Texas Permian Basin. Airbus SE has committed to buy several hundred thousand credits of removal tied to the project.How effective do you think carbon removal will be at fighting climate change? Join the conversation below.</em>Climeworks raised about $650 million in equity from investors including Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. and private-equity firm Partners Group Holding AG early last year. It has also raised debt from Microsofts $1 billion climate-innovation fund.The company is building a second facility in Iceland that will be capable of removing about 36,000 metric tons a year.It is eyeing U.S. expansion with the government doling out about $3.5 billion through the 2021 infrastructure bill to develop four regional direct-air capture hubs. The European Union is also taking steps to grow the sector.""The support that governments have provided is a game changer,"" said Zeke Hausfather, Stripes climate-research lead.Carbon removal differs from efforts that capture carbon in factory smokestacks, which are being proposed by energy companies. Carbon removal is one of the potential technological solutions to climate change, but it will be decades before it makes a dent in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and critics say it could provide an excuse for business-as-usual policies on fossil fuels.Skeptics question using huge amounts of energy and resources to build massive machines in the name of fighting climate change. Climeworks Iceland facility runs on renewable geothermal energy-meaning its associated emissions are minimal-and a different startup pumps the carbon underground after dissolving it in vast amounts of water.Industry executives say that direct-air capture is one of the few solutions for large-scale carbon removal that can mitigate unavoidable emissions and that costs will come down as the industry matures.They hope for a future where people pay for carbon removal like how they pay for trash collection. To make that point, Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of Climeworks, threw trash bags on stage during a talk a few years ago in London.",7
8,2023-01-12,Chinas Junk-Bond Market Creaks Open With a $400 Million Sale - WSJ,Dalian Wanda Commercial Management Groups transaction could inspire other real-estate firms to make offerings,"HONG KONG-A Chinese commercial property company sold U.S. dollar bonds on Thursday with yields topping 12%, reopening the market for junk debt from the country after a wave of defaults last year.Dalian Wanda Commercial Management Group Co., which operates shopping malls across China and is controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin, tested investors appetite for risk this week with a two-year bond offering by one of its units.The unit sold bonds with a $400 million face value and an 11% coupon. The securities were sold at 97.6 cents on the dollar, which enabled the deal to be priced to yield 12.375%. The new debt was rated BB by Fitch Ratings and Ba3 by Moodys Investors Service, levels that sit in the highest category of speculative-grade ratings.The transaction could inspire other Chinese real-estate firms to come back to the table to discuss potential deals, some investment bankers predicted. But Leonard Law, a senior credit analyst at research firm Lucror Analytics, said investors should be wary about reading too much into the deal.""I cant definitely say that the offshore bond market has reopened for property developers,"" Mr. Law said.Many investors dumped Chinese high-yield dollar bonds last year, after residential-property giants China Evergrande Group, Kaisa Group, Sunac China and many of their peers defaulted on their international debt. New junk-debt issuance slowed to a trickle as bond prices collapsed and yields soared, making it too costly for most companies to borrow.The average yield on outstanding junk dollar bonds from Chinese companies that havent defaulted hit a record high of 33% in October 2022, according to an ICE BofA index that tracks them.In November, Chinese authorities unveiled a series of measures designed to help surviving property developers obtain access to financing, lowering their default risk and sparking a junk-bond rally. That has taken the average yield for sub-investment-grade Chinese dollar bonds down to about 17%.Dalian Wanda Commercial Management Groups business is different from that of residential apartment sellers such as Country Garden Holdings Co. and its peers. The former describes itself as the worlds largest commercial-properties holding, managing and operating enterprise, that manages hundreds of Wanda Plazas across China. Proceeds from the debt sale, which was led by Credit Suisse, will help refinance the groups existing debt.While sales of Asian investment-grade bonds have been on a tear so far this year, investors are likely to remain cautious when it comes to high-yield bonds, said Freddy Wong, head of Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco.Any fresh issuance in the Chinese dollar junk-bond market will be skewed toward companies with stable fundamentals, he said. ""For now, the market is not telling you that they are fully ready,"" Mr. Wong added.Matthew Thomas contributed to this article.",8
9,2023-01-12,"What, if Anything, Can You Do to Prepare for a Recession? - WSJ","Textbook advice may be unhelpful in the event of an economic slowdown, but there are small steps to take","There is no guarantee a recession is coming in 2023 and it is likely too late for people to make any major financial preparations even if they are convinced one is imminent.Many economists and business leaders expect a recession this year. In October, economists surveyed in a quarterly Wall Street Journal poll on average estimated that there was a 63% chance of a recession in the following 12 months.The best ways to fortify your finances, economists and financial advisers say, are to beef up your emergency savings, pay off any high-interest debt and develop alternative income streams.But this advicepresents a problem. If you havent already started doing these things and a recession does happen soon, financial researchers and economists say you are too late to make significant headway. To truly prepare for an imminent recession, many Americans would need a time machine, so that they could go and overhaul their finances.""Hopefully, you are aware and have been putting those things in practice before a recession is coming,"" says Damon Jones, an economist at the University of Chicagos Harris School of Public Policy. ""Its hard to just put some of those things in place in the very short run.""Christopher Lyman, a financial planner at Allied Financial Advisors, LLC in Newtown, Pa., says that when his clients are worried about a recession, he sometimes reminds them that having a long-term financial plan that accounts for downturns means not having to ask yourself in a panic what to do when one comes.If you think a recession is likely, what steps are you taking to prepare? Join the conversation below.</em>""You want to prepare for that stuff before the winter sets in, not in the middle of winter,"" Mr. Lyman says. ""You need to worry about that in summer and fall.""For many, financial vulnerability during a recession results in part from poor spending and saving habits. Credit-card balances have been growing over the past year, and Americans personal saving rate was 2.4% in November, down from 7.1% the year before,according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.But it can also arise from forces beyond peoples control, says Prof. Jones. History suggests some groups of workers are more prone to losing their job in a recession, and some industries tend to shed more jobs. While tech layoffs have been notable lately, in prior recessions the hospitality and construction industries have tended to get hit particularly hard, says Jonathan Parker, a finance professor at MITs Sloan School of Management.Moreover, telling someone to boost their savings when they are living paycheck to paycheck in a low-wage job is impractical advice. Preparing for a recession is often most challenging for those who have fewer resources to begin with, says Prof. Jones.""Theres a spectrum, and as you go further down in terms of how much you have in assets, the less practical this advice becomes,"" Prof. Jones says of guidelines for attaining financial security.Among households with an income of $75,000 or more, 62% said that they could cover an unexpected $1,000 expense with their savings, according to a January 2022 survey from the financial website Bankrate. In households earning under $30,000, 22% said the same.The best strategy is to always be preparing for recessions, says Cliff Robb, a professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies financial decision-making. Which means now is as good a time as any to get started.If you cant sock away significant money in an emergency fund right now, starting small is OK. And there are things you can do at the moment to better position yourself for a possible recession.It helps to mentally prepare for hard times before they arrive, says Prof. Parker. Workers can prepare for the possibility of a layoff by researching ahead of time whether they would be eligible for unemployment insurance and coming up with a detailed strategy for finding another job.""Those are really useful, just to think ahead a little bit, because it is hard in times of stress to figure out alternative plans,"" Prof. Parker says.If youre worried about the possibility of losing your income in a recession, Prof. Jones says it can also be wise for people to hold off on any financial decisions that would lock them into hefty recurring payments, such as buying a fancier car or a bigger house. ""Those leave you less flexible to adapt to negative surprises,"" he says.People may not be able to wholly renovate their personal finances on the spot, but they can still make certain adjustments immediately, Mr. Lyman, the financial planner in Pennsylvania, says. If you have cash that is earning low interest, you could move it into an account with a higher yield. It also pays to look for ways to trim your expenses.""Even if its not cutting your budget by that much, at least it still gives you that peace of mind that, All right, Ive done something to try and safeguard against this,"" Mr. Lyman says.",9
10,2023-01-12,American Companies Face Pressure on the Margins - WSJ,"Earnings are weakening, but profit margins are still extremely high and likely to deteriorate","Earnings at big public companies havent been growing all that much lately. Which isnt to say that companies havent been extremely profitable.Earnings season is getting under way, and results for the final quarter of last year look to be underwhelming. Analysts latest estimates are for earnings per share for members of the S&amp;P 500 to have shrunk by 2.2% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier-a figure that is flattered by an expected 65% gain in energy-sector earnings. Exclude those, and analysts estimate earnings fell by 6.7%.Actual results likely wont be quite so bad, since by the time companies start reporting analysts have typically lowered estimates to the point that most companies easily exceed them. But they will probably still count as a deep disappointment based on where expectations stood a year ago, when analysts thought that fourth-quarter 2022 S&amp;P 500 earnings would register a 14.3% gain.Two things hit companies at once in the past year. First, sales growth weakened as economies around the world struggled. Second, costs rose faster than sales, cutting into bottom lines. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices estimates that S&amp;P 500 operating margins fell to 12.1% in the fourth quarter from 13.4% a year earlier. But 12.1% is still very high: In the prepandemic fourth quarter of 2019, S&amp;P 500 operating margins stood at 10.6%.This is a reflection of how much margins benefited from the Covid crisis: Sales, buoyed by heady demand and the higher prices that companies were able to charge, ran ahead of costs. Remarkably, analysts expect profit margins to widen again, with Refinitiv showing that they expect S&amp;P 500 earnings will be 10.9% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 from a year earlier, versus sales growth of just 3.9%.Yet it seems more likely that profit margins will narrow in the year ahead. At the very least, one might expect them to slip back to where they were before the pandemic as the economy continues to normalize. That on its own could drag S&amp;P 500 earnings down by over 10% relative to where they would be if margins held steady.Whats your outlook on corporate earnings this year? Join the conversation below.</em>The recession that many economists are forecasting this year could make the profit picture even worse, since in downturns companies sales typically deteriorate more quickly than they can lower their costs. Over the past 75 years, corporate profits as a share of gross domestic product-a proxy for profit margins-have slipped during nearly every recession.The best outcome for earnings probably would be for both the U.S. and overseas economies to start growing at faster clips, generating the sales growth companies need to more easily absorb costs. With the Federal Reserve and other central banks still raising interest rates, however, a rebound in profit growth looks less like a story for 2023 than one for 2024.",10
